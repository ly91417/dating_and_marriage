The capital of <place>Jamaica</place> furthers its case as cultural destination, not just a stopover to the beach. Stay at the <place>Courtyard</place> by <place>Marriott</place>, Kingston’s first new hotel in over a decade, or the SoHo-style <place>Spanish Court Hotel</place>, which has added a second pool, and will open its <place>Montego Bay</place> branch in the summer. Eat like an Olympic legend at <place>Usain Bolt</place>’s restaurant <place>Tracks</place>; <place>Records</place>, or get all things jerk at the latest hot spot <place>Chateau</place> 7 <place>Gourmet Jerk Centre</place>. Take in old-school reggae at the One World Ska and Rocksteady Music Festival, launched this November; at the newly opened <place>Peter Tosh Museum</place>, honoring the former Wailer; or at one of the dub music parties debuting around the city. And if you still want beach, hop on the freshly completed <place>North-South Highway</place> and arrive in <place>Ocho Rios</place> in under two hours.— Baz Dreisinger
