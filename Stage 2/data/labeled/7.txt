This desolate English path has killed more than 100 people

If you consult a large-scale map of the <place>Essex</place> coastline between the <place>River Crouch</place> and the <place>River Thames</place>, you will see a footpath – its route marked with a stitch-line of crosses and dashes – leaving the land at a place called <place>Wakering Stairs</place> and then heading due east, straight out to sea. Several hundred yards offshore, it curls northeast and runs in this direction for around three miles, still offshore, before cutting back to make landfall at Fisherman’s Head, the uppermost tip of a large, low-lying and little-known marshy island called <place><place>Foulness</place></place>.

The <place>Broomway</place> is thought to have killed more than 100 people over the centuries
This is the <place>Broomway</place>, allegedly “the deadliest” path in <place>Britain</place>, and certainly the unearthliest path I have ever walked. The <place>Broomway</place> is thought to have killed more than 100 people over the centuries; it seems likely that there were other victims whose fates went unrecorded. Sixty-six of its dead are buried in the little <place>Foulness</place> churchyard; the other bodies were not recovered. Edwardian newspapers, alert to the path’s reputation, rechristened it “The Doomway”.

Even the Ordnance Survey map registers, in its sober fashion, the gothic atmosphere of the path. Printed in large pink lettering on the 1:25,000 map of that stretch of coast is the following message:

WARNING Public Rights of Way across <place>Maplin Sands</place> can be dangerous. Seek local guidance.

The <place>Broomway</place> traverses vast sand flats and mud flats that stretch almost unsloped for miles. When the tide goes out at <place>Foulness</place>, it goes out a great distance, revealing shires of sand packed hard enough to support the weight of a walker. When the tide comes back in, though, it comes fast – galloping over the sands quicker than a human can run.

Disorientation is a danger as well as inundation: in mist, rain or fog, it is easy to lose direction in such self-similar terrain, with shining sand extending in all directions. Nor are all of the surfaces that you encounter reliable: there is mud that can trap you and quicksand that can swallow you. But in good weather, following the right route, it can feel nothing more than a walk on a very large beach.

Until 1932, the <place>Broomway</place> was the only means of getting to and from <place>Foulness</place>, save by boat
The <place>Broomway</place> takes its name from the 400 or so brooms that were formerly placed at intervals of between 30 and 60 yards on either side of the track, thereby indicating the safe passage on the hard sand that lay between them. Until 1932, the <place>Broomway</place> was the only means of getting to and from <place>Foulness</place> save by boat, for the island was isolated from the mainland by uncrossable creeks and stretches of mud known as the <place>Black Grounds</place>. The island is currently controlled by the Ministry of Defence, which purchased it during the First World War for “research purposes” and continues to conduct artillery-firing tests out over the sands.

The route of the <place>Broomway</place> seems to have been broadly consistent since at least 1419 (when it is referred to in a manorial record for <place>Foulness</place>). Conceptually, it is close to paradox. It is a right of way and as such is inscribed on maps and in law, but is also swept clean of the trace of passage twice daily by the tide. What do you call a path that is no path? A riddle? A sequence of compass bearings? A Zen koan?

Before I left, my friend Patrick had given me a warning: “The <place>Broomway</place> will be there another day, but if you try to walk it in mist, you may not be. So if it’s misty when you arrive at Wakering Stairs, turn around and go home.”

It was misty when I arrived at <place>Wakering Stairs</place>. Early on a Sunday morning, and the air was white. It wasn’t a haar, a proper <place>North Sea</place> mist that blanked out the world. More of a dense sea haze. But visibility was poor enough that the foghorns were sounding, great bovine reverbs drifting up and down the coast. I stood on the sea wall, looking out into the mist, feeling the foghorns vibrating in my chest, and wondering if I could imaginatively re-categorise the weather conditions such that I could disregard Patrick’s final warning. I felt queasy with anxiety, but eager to walk.

With me, also nervous, was my old friend David Quentin, who I had convinced to join me on the path.

Where the road met the sea wall, there was a heavy metal stop-barrier, tagged with a jay-blue graffiti scrawl. A red firing flag drooped at the foot of a tall flagpole. Beyond the stop-barrier was a bank of signs in waspy yellow-and-black type and imperative grammar, detailing bye-laws, tautologically identifying themselves as warnings, indemnifying the MoD against drownings, explosions and mud deaths, offering caveats to the walker, and grudgingly admitting that this was, indeed, the start of a public right of way:

Warning: The <place>Broomway</place> is unmarked and very hazardous to pedestrians.

But we were both still anxious about straying far from the notional path of the <place>Broomway</place>, and encountering the black mud or the quicksand.
Our directions said that we should reach something called the Maypole, a sunken telegraph pole with crosspieces that marked the southeastern edge of a tidal channel named Havengore Creek. But scale behaved strangely, and we weren’t paying sufficient attention to our pacings and distances. We became confused by other spars sticking up from the mud here and there: relics of wrecks, perhaps, or more likely the mark points of former channels long since silted up by the shifting sands.

Eventually, reluctantly, nearly two miles offshore, with the tide approaching its turn and our worries at last starting to rise through our calm – black mud through sand – we began a long slow arc back towards the coastline and the path of the <place>Broomway</place>, away from the outermost point. There was the return of bearings, the approach to land, a settling to recognisability.
