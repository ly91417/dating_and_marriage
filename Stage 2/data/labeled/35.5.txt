In February, <place>Dubrovnik</place> mirrors <place>Venice</place> with a five-week medieval carnival that transforms marble streets into a parade of masked balls.
There's also a wine and jazz festival during the more tranquil month of September.

One of <place>Europe</place>'s most attractive drives is the 20-kilometer <place>Dubrovnik</place> to <place>Cavtat</place> coastal route.

The mountaintop route wends through vineyards and quaint waterfront villages. Antique churches, forested headlands, beach boats and cafes are all part of the scenery.

There are coastal resorts at <place>Cavtat</place>, <place>Mlini</place> and <place>Srebreno</place>, away from the bustle of <place>Dubrovnik</place>.

<place>Mlini</place> offers isolated beaches and dense greenery.

<place>Cavtat</place> is charmingly Croatian and sometimes sprinkled with famous faces said to include Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich.

The famous <place>Nautika Restaurant</place> (on the left) has a front-row seat to the setting of <place>King's Landing</place> in 'Game of Thrones'.
