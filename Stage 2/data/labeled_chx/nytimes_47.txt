<place>Busan</place> is knownas a film town, but the city’s independent design scene is taking off, too. The <place>Jeonpo Cafe District</place>, a once-gritty industrial area, has recently been transformed into a creative hub packed with boutiques like Object, selling handcrafted items by locals. Nearby, a 1920s former hospital reopened in 2016 as <place>Brown Hands Cafe</place>, an atmospheric art space. There are new ventures to showcase local design, too: the annual <place>Busan</place> Design Festival and <place>Busan</place> Design Spot, a guide to local attractions.— Justin Bergman
