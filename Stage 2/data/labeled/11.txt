An archipelago of killer cats

"In 23 June 1984, I was attacked.”

Phoni Gyen took a seat on a dock overlooking the still waterways of the <place>Sundarbans</place>, a low-lying archipelago in the <place>Ganges Delta</place>, and settled quickly into his gory sermon. A wispy grey hairline retreated from a scarred, sun-dyed face, like a litter-choked river exposing a dry, cracked riverbed.

“We’d spent the morning fishing,” he said, his small audience fidgeting in the fierce Bengal sun. “I was on the riverbank when I heard a noise coming from the trees.

“I tried to run, but before I could move it was on top of me.”

Phoni Gyen was attacked by a tiger in 1984 while fishing in the <place>Sundarbans</place>.

A tiger had pounced on Gyen from a nearby palm tree, pinning him to the ground. A suffocating paw compressed his chest and razor-sharp claws tore at his face.

“I was sure I was going to die.”

Armed with just a stick, someone from Gyen’s fishing party jumped from their boat and attempted to unclasp the fierce predator.

“The tiger looked at him,” Gyen continued, mopping perspiration from his face, “then it jumped off me, took this man in its jaws and disappeared into the forest.”

I was sure I was going to die.
Tigers are a startlingly common hazard for the people of the <place>Sundarbans</place>, located on the border between southern <place>Bangladesh</place> and the Indian state of <place>West Bengal</place>. Here, a resilient community has made their home among the islands of thick mangrove forests, a <place>Unesco World Heritage Site</place> that’s home to a large population of Bengal tigers, with an estimated 150 big cats active in the region.

I could see the scars from this unlikely domestic arrangement among the small crowd of locals who had gathered with me on the outskirts of Dayapur Village, the entry point to the <place>Sundarbans</place>, to hear Gyen’s harrowing tale.

The area is a <place>Unesco World Heritage Site</place> that’s home to about 150 tigers.
