Why Go to <place>St. Kitts & Nevis</place>
These lesser-known but luxurious twin islands in the southern Caribbean are breathtaking. <place>St. Kitts</place> and Nevis beckon to travelers looking for a mix of resort relaxation and picturesque landscapes with a touch of adventure and a dash of history. <place>St. Kitts</place> is the more outgoing sister, with the widest selection of restaurants, bars and hotels. Shy and lush <place>Nevis</place> showcases the opulence that has become this region's calling card.

Seclusion might be the No. 1 draw (<place>Nevis</place> doesn't have a single streetlight), but there are many other lures. Take, for example, the sloping greens of <place>Royal St. Kitts Golf Club</place> . You want culture? These islands have it – just check out the wintertime <place>St. Kitts Carnival</place> or the music festival held every June. And those with a penchant for history will certainly find it – <place>Nevis</place> is the birth island of founding father Alexander Hamilton; <place>St. Kitts</place>' imposing <place>Brimstone Hill Fortress</place> was once known as the "Gibraltar of the West Indies" and the <place>St. Kitts Scenic Railway</place> educates travelers on the area's sugar cane roots. Meanwhile, those who come strictly for the beach can relax with a good book on a number of white-sand oases, such as <place>Oualie Beach</place> and <place>Frigate Bay</place> .
