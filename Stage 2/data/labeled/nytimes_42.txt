Visitors to this hinterland 40 miles north of <place>Kathmandu</place> dwindled following the 2015 avalanche that nearly wiped out <place>Langtang</place> village, the nerve center of the area. In an effort to revive tourism, the travel outfitter Intrepid now offers a spectacular 15-day <place>Tamang</place> Heritage Trail Trek through alpine terrain, verdant midlands, rustic villages and monasteries. The newly opened portion of <place>Langtang National Park</place> called the <place>Tamang Heritage Trail</place> affords an opportunity to meet the <place>Tamang</place> people, originally Tibetan horse traders.â€” Charu Suri
