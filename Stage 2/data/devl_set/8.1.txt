“Hold onto <place>Lima</place>,” Healy-Rennison commanded, as I tightly pinched the speckle-feathered bird’s jesses, or tethers, under my thumb.

“Now she’s ‘under your thumb’,” Healy-Rennison explained with a smile.

Healy-Rennison then covered the bird’s eyes and head with a small leather hood to keep her from distraction until we reached our hunting spot.

<place>Lima</place> only roused slightly when I removed her hood, fluffing out her feathers before settling back into to her sleek, sharp self. Then she hurled forward, dashing upwards into the highest tree.

pped down to the ground and began crawling around on all fours. My first falconry lesson had reduced me to the same state as the rodents we were hunting, but like the haunting harp music of the <place>Emerald Isle</place>, this is tradition.

Humans have hunted with birds of prey for thousands of years, and for nearly 800 years at <place>Ashford Castle</place>. Built in 1228, the old Norman castle evolved into an elaborate chateau, eventually purchased by the Guinness family and transformed into a Victorian hunting lodge. To that end, the beer barons expanded the estate to more than 26,000 acres (larger than <place>Manhattan</place>), conserving the kind of old-growth forest that once covered the whole of the British Isles.

This is what all of <place>Ireland</place> used to look like, I told myself while rummaging in the underbrush under <place>Lima</place>’s watchful gaze. Everything was forest, and filled with fairies, say the legends. Prime leprechaun habitat too, I thought.

“So, they used to hunt mice and squirrels in medieval times?” I asked stupidly.
