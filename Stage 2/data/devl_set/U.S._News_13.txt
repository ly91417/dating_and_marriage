Why Go to <place>Las Vegas</place>
<place>Sin City</place>, America's Playground, the Entertainment Capital of the World ... all worthy names for this Nevada hotspot. Think of Vegas as a theme park rather than a city â€” it can awe as much as it can overwhelm, and that's part of the appeal. This is a city where inhibitions are not welcome: Every night, <place>Las Vegas</place> draws pleasuremongers to the brightly lit Strip like moths to a flame. While you may not want to go as far as to re-enact "The Hangover," you certainly don't want to leave without experiencing a bit of "Viva Las Vegas." Just remember: What happens here, stays here.

But gone are the days when Sin City appealed only to bachelors and brutes. Today, <place>Las Vegas</place> as a destination is just as malleable as it is ostentatious in that you can mold it into any type of vacation you like. You can opt for the traditional high-roller getaway complete with all-nighters at the blackjack table or PURE Nightclub. Or you can take a different approach to Sin City and indulge in its luxury spas, high-end shopping and gourmet restaurants. Las Vegas also makes a great jumping-off point for outdoor activities, such as hiking in <place>Red Rock Canyon<place> or visiting the <place>Hoover Dam<place>. And though you may not believe it, this city even has attractions for kids: Underage travelers will get a kick out of a Cirque du Soleil performance, the Bellagio Fountain show and the <place>Neon Museum<place>.
