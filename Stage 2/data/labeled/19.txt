How to drink baijiu: <place>Beijing</place>'s pros share their tips

Euromonitor International, a <place>London</place>-based consultancy estimated about 5.5 billion liters, or 1.5 billion gallons of baijiu sold last year. 
<place>Beijing</place> (CNN)It's the most widely drunk hard liquor in the world but it's rarely found on cocktail menus.

Baijiu, distilled from sorghum and rice, rules every festive occasion in <place>China</place>, where it's the tipple of choice for everything from wedding receptions to business banquets.

It's especially popular during celebrations for the Lunar New Year, which began Saturday, when shot glasses filled with the potent spirit are thrown back and slammed down on the table in endless rounds of toasts.

<place>Beijing</place>, Baijiu, Bites and Business

"Many (foreigners) find baijiu off-putting, but it's not about the liquor itself," says Bill Isler, co-founder of <place>Beijing</place>'s Capital Spirits, the world's first baijiu-themed bar.
Isler says the drink's fearsome reputation comes from visitors being coerced into excessive drinking by Chinese friends or coworkers -- persuading people to drink is a gesture of generosity and "being a good host," he says.

But Isler wants to change the way baijiu is regarded and consumed. His bar serves different types of the fiery spirit as well as baijiu cocktails.

It's a push shared by distillers -- sales of high-end baijiu brands like Moutai have slowed as President Xi Jinping has reined in officials' expense accounts as part of an anti-corruption drive.
Young, hip, bar flies are a potential new market.

"It is definitely getting more exposure," says Isler.

Thanks to <place>China</place>'s huge population, baijiu accounts for almost a third of global spirit sales.
