Why Go to <place>San Diego</place>
Consistently sunny weather and 70 miles of magnificent coastline are what draw active types to <place>San Diego</place> throughout the year: that and the mouthwatering cuisine, thriving nightlife and one of the country's favorite zoos. And then there are the beaches: Retreat to <place>Mission Beach</place> to soak up the rays, to <place>La Jolla</place> to catch a wave and to Coronado for a leisurely seaside stroll. When you're ready to ditch your flip-flops and board shorts for more formal attire, you'll find pockets of vivacious nightlife throughout, especially near the historical <place>Gaslamp Quarter</place> .

America's Finest City is a confluence of different communities defined by the area's military and Hispanic heritage: San Diego is home of the <place>U.S. Navyâ€™s Pacific Fleet</place> and sits adjacent to the <place>U.S.-Mexico border</place> . In spite of constant growth (and its title as California's second-largest city), San Diego maintains a small-town feel, making it a popular destination for families and anyone looking for a laid-back, Southern California getaway in the sun.
