Long overshadowed by <place>Dalmatia</place> to the south, <place>Croatia</place>’s <place>Istria</place> region is gaining new attention thanks to developments like <place>Family Hotel Amarin</place>, a child-friendly, 280-room beach resort that opened last year, and the <place>Valamar Isabella</place>, which opened on tiny <place>Sveti Nikola</place> island in 2015. Boutique lodgings have popped up in charming fishing towns like <place>Novigrad</place>, home to the 13-room <place>Rivalmare</place>. Thankfully, <place>Istria</place>’s other attractions —Roman ruins, fresh truffles, great wines and incredible seafood — are timeless.— Evan Rail
