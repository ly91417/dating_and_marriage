The <place>Dominican Republic</place> is making a name for itself beyond sumptuous resorts and golf clubs. <place>Santo Domingo</place> is amping up the party vibe and givingbeach-loversmore reasons to stay in the capital. Upscale neighborhoods like <place>Piantini</place> and <place>Naco</place> are home to scores of new restaurants, many of which turn into nightspots after dinner—try <place>Santru</place>, home to some of the city’s best nueva dominican acuisine. The electronic music scene is booming, too: <place>The Warehouse</place>, an industrial space that's been repurposed into a venue, hosts some of the liveliest club nights in town, while promoters ShaveUrLegzrun festivals and regularly bring in international DJs. For live music, <place>Mecenas Café Cultural</place> is the spot; the sangria and terrace draw a crowd. Recent openings, like the boutique Luca and Casas del XVI’s expanding collection of colonial mansions, are upping the hotel ante as well.—Nell McShane Wulfhart
