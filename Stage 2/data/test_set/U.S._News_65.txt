Why Go to <place>Cusco</place>
<place>Cusco</place>, known as the archaeological capital of the Americas, is home to a storied history that included the rise and fall of the Inca Empire followed by the invasion of Spanish conquistadors in the early 1500s. Today, remnants of both eras share the narrow city streets – from centuries-old baroque cathedrals to exquisite stone masonry – creating a rare collision of Andean and Spanish styles that makes <place>Cusco</place> like no other place on earth.

The city has come out of the shadow of <place>Peru</place>’s capital, Lima, in recent decades. Millions of tourists make the pilgrimage from Cusco and the Sacred Valley to get a glimpse of <place>South America</place>'s greatest spectacle: Machu Picchu. Discovered by American explorer Hiram Bingham in the early 20th century, the fabled ruins are one of the most impressive architectural feats of the ancient world. But the enchanting city offers more: from the glimmering Qorikancha (Temple of the Sun) to scrumptious Andean cuisine. It only takes a day to be charmed by this significant Peruvian city and all its wonders.
