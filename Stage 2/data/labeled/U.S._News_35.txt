Why Go to <place>Puerto Vallarta</place>
This is more than just a coastal resort getaway. Somehow <place>Puerto Vallarta</place> — also known as "Vallarta" or just "PV" — maintains a small-town atmosphere, while still boasting one of the most unique and sophisticated oceanfronts in <place>Mexico</place> . The dining options and the hotel choices reflect more of the same — you'll find both elegance and efficiency mingled together within the hotel and restaurant areas.

Most people associate this west coast town with its boundaries — the <place>Banderas Bay</place> that snakes along the coast or the palm tree-lined <place>Sierra Madre Mountains</place> that stand tall in the east — but <place>Puerto Vallarta</place> is more than its scenery. Take some time to discover its other perks for yourself by sampling the delicious food, discovering a hidden boutique in the <place>Zona Romantica</place>, sipping a signature cocktail at a bar along the Malecón or dancing to a salsa beat in a Havana-style nightclub.
