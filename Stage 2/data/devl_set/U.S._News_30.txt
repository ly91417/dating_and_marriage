Why Go to <place>Tulum</place>
In the past decade, Tulum has grown into a coveted vacation for luxury travelers; however, it still tempts bargain hunters who remember when this tucked-away jewel of Mexico's east coast was more of a secluded getaway. Here, you'll find some of the best-preserved Mayan ruins in the Western Hemisphere, ruins that have the cerulean waters of the <place>Caribbean Sea</place> as a backdrop. And there are other out-of-this-world wonders, including several cenotes (or underground water-filled caverns) and bioreserves. As an added plus: <place>Tulum</place> continues to be the tiny, quiet alternative to the other Riviera Maya resort areas during the spring break season.s
