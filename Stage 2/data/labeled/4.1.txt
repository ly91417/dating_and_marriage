Those with stronger language skills can venture further afield. “Here in <place>Atuntaqui</place> [100km north of <place>Quito</place>], a town of about 20,000, we are essentially the only expats and we like it that way,” said Bill Hagan, originally from <place>Kansas</place> City and a guide for travel start-up Your Local Cousin. “However <place>Cotacachi</place> is 15 minutes away in private vehicle, so if we want to interact with other expats or enjoy North American cuisine, we can.”


<place>Mexico</place>
Much like <place>Malta</place>, <place>Mexico</place> draws many expats initially for its warm weather, but welcoming locals and a culture rich in traditions and food keeps residents happy over the long haul.

“<place>Mexico</place> is an amazing country rich with thousands of years of history and culture, fantastic beaches, wonderful archaeological sites and colonial cities,” said Samira Hosseini, an InterNations ambassador originally from <place>Iran</place>, who now lives in the city of <place>Monterrey</place>, 150 miles west of the <place>Texas</place> border. “In particular, the diverse and colourful cuisine of <place>Mexico</place> is hard to resist.”

Many Western expats seek out beach towns like <place>Tulum</place> on the <place>Gulf Coast</place> or <place>Puerto Vallarta</place> on the Pacific Coast, but <place>Mexico City</place>, in the central part of the country, is truly the country’s mecca.

<place>Mexico City</place> is a mecca for expats looking to learn more about culture.

“<place>Mexico City</place> is as metropolitan as it gets,” said InterNations ambassador Biokrobo Samson Wokoma, originally from <place>Nigeria</place>. He recommends expats live in <place>Mexico City</place>’s central neighbourhoods of <place>La Condesa</place>, <place>La Roma</place>, <place>Escandon</place> and <place>Napoles</place>, which are affordable and have easy access to restaurants, bars and clubs. They area also close to the Metro-bus, Metro-train and Eco-bicycle systems for easy commuting to the rest of the city, and most residents have at least a working knowledge of English, making assimilation easier.

<place>New Zealand</place>
The country’s stunning natural beauty draws people from across the world, and with easy access to both cities and beaches, expats usually adopt the local relaxed lifestyle.

<place>Queenstown</place> is popular with those who want to enjoy natural surroundings.

“I initially moved to <place>New Zealand</place> with my parents, but I have lived overseas since then and returned because I missed the laidback lifestyle and kind and friendly people and environment,” said Purva Bhatnagar, an InterNations Ambassador who grew up in <place>Hong Kong</place> and <place>Singapore</place>. She notes that a typical Kiwi works 8:30 am to 5 pm, never overtime, and enjoys meals and weekend activities, like house parties, road trips or “tramping” (Kiwi slang for hiking), with their family.

For the most metropolitan experience, Bhatnagar suggests <place>Auckland</place>, which she describes as “the <place>New York</place> of <place>New Zealand</place>”. <place>Wellington</place> is a little less populated, but as the capital has an abundance of government, education and technology jobs. Tourist hub <place>Queenstown</place> is popular with those who want to enjoy the natural surroundings to the fullest, or with people in the services industry.
