The city of <place>Lucerne’s</place> medieval charms continue to draw busloads of tourists, but neighboring <place>Lake Lucerne</place> is full of developments that entice visitors to venture out as well. Make your base the ultramodern Bürgenstock, a $480 million project that opens in mid 2017 with scenic lake views, four hotels, and a massive yet tranquil spa. From there, explore the craggy summit of <place>Mount Pilatus</place> once thought to be adragonden, it’s become more accessible lately (its popular cog railway will be included in the Swiss Travel Pass starting this year). At the lake’s southern arm, calledLake <place>Uri</place>, the 36-mile-longGotthard Base Tunnel(the world’s longest train tunnel) opens for passenger service in December 2016—it has shaved 40 minutes off the trip from <place>Milan</place>. Hikers to the region won’t be disappointed either: the nearby <place>village Engelberg</place> has created the Buiräbähnli Safari, a two-night Alpine trek that utilizes farmer’s gondolas and aerial cable cars to visit remote farms, where you can sample cheese and Alpine butter.—Adam H.
