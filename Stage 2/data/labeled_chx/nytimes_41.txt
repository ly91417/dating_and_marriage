A traffic armstill swings down to close the main road into <place>Placencia</place> in southern <place>Belize</place> whenever a small plane lands on its narrow peninsula. More of those planes may be stalling golf carts, a popular form of transportation here, with the recent opening of <place>Naïa Resort</place> and <place>Spa</place>, offering 35 beach houses, a yoga studio and a juice bar. The boutique <place>Itz’ana Resort</place>; Residences will follow in March with a locavore restaurant, five-room spa and rum bar. The laid-back beach town offers access to the <place>Belize Barrier Reef</place>, prime waters for seasonally diving with whale sharks, which were recently deemed endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.— Elaine Glusac
