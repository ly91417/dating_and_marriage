<place>Petrified Forest National Monument</place>, <place>Arizona</place> – On December 8, 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt created this national monument, now <place>Petrified Forest National Park</place>, to protect the area's beautiful petrified wood.

<place>Muir Woods National Monument</place>, <place>California</place> – When conservationist John Muir heard that William and Elizabeth Kent had purchased a redwood forest north of <place>San Francisco</place> to protect it and named it after him, Muir said, "This is the best tree-lovers monument that could possibly be found in all the forests of the world." President Theodore Roosevelt created <place>Muir Woods National Monument</place> on land donated to the federal government by the Kents on January 9, 1908.

<place>Natural Bridges National Monument</place> , <place>Utah</place> – Credit goes to flowing waters and flash floods for carving out three mighty bridges over millions of years at <place>Natural Bridges National Monument</place> in the southeastern corner of <place>Utah</place>. Hunter-gatherers lived in the area off and on, dating back to 7000 B.C. President Theodore Roosevelt crated <place>Utah</place>'s first <place>National Park</place> Service area on April 16, 1908.

<place>Navajo National Monument</place>, <place>Arizona</place> – The Anasazi, also called Ancestral Puebloans, started settling down in the <place>Four Corners</place> region about 2,000 years ago. <place>Keet Seel</place>, <place>Betatakin</place> and <place>Inscription House</place> -- the three cliff dwellings protected by <place>Navajo National Monument</place> -- date to around 1250 to 1300. On March 20, 1909, President Theodore Roosevelt established <place>Navajo National Monument</place>, named for the people who live on <place>Navajo Nation</place> land now, to protect those ancient homes.

<place>Mukuntuweap National Monument</place>, <place>Utah</place> – People have walked the land now called <place>Zion National Park</place> since 6000 B.C., yet it wasn't until a 1908 federal land survey that the stunning beauty of Zion was broadcast to outsiders. The surveyors immediately recommended that President William Taft protect the lands, which he did on July 31, 1909, calling it <place>Mukuntuweap National Monument</place>. It became <place>Zion National Monument</place> in 1918 and <place>Zion National Park</place> in 1919. 

<place>Glacier National Park</place>, <place>Montana</place> – Glaciers have been carving their way through <place>Glacier National Park</place> for millennia, and humans have been in the area for about 10,000 years. There are still reservations abutting and near the national park site, and the park land is spiritually important to local tribes. In the late 1800s, "Forest & Stream" editor George Bird Grinnell started lobbying for Glacier to become a national park. He succeeded on May 11, 1910.

<place>Rainbrow Bridge National Monument</place>, <place>Utah</place> – Sacred to the Native American nations who live near it, <place>Rainbow Bridge</place> in <place>Utah </place>is one of the world's largest known natural bridges. While visitors can see the bridge and hike the trails at the national monument, which was created on May 30, 1910, it's still used as a spiritual site. Since 1995, the park service has been working with neighboring tribes to ensure the spirituality of the space is respected.

<place>Colorado National Monument</place> – The land in the <place>Colorado Plateau</place>'s northeast corner, designated the <place>Colorado National Monument</place> on May 24, 1911, had a fervent protector in John Otto, the park's first custodian and fiercest advocate. Otto first discovered the red-rock canyons south of <place>Grand Junction</place> in 1906, and he built the first trails to reach the canyons.

<place>Rocky Mountain National Park</place>, <place>Colorado</place> – Glaciers have carved out the landscape of <place>Rocky Mountain National Park</place>, where more than 60 peaks stand higher than 12,000 feet. The land became U.S. territory with the 1803 <place>Louisiana</place> Purchase and attracted hunters, ranchers, miners and homesteaders. Local naturalists started agitating for conservation, and President Woodrow Wilson created the national park on January 26, 1915.

<place>Dinosaur National Monument</place>, <place>Utah</place> and <place>Colorado</place> – It was 149 million years ago when dinosaurs roamed the land now protected by the monument named for them. They became extinct about 59 million years ago, but their legacy lives on in the fossils left behind.

Eliot, John D. Rockefeller Jr. and textile heir George B. Dorr.
