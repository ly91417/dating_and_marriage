There’s a lot going onin the <place>City of Lakes</place> this year: the new <place>U.S. Bank Stadium</place> is hosting the X Games in July, and the <place>Walker Art Center</place> will open its popular sculpture garden after an extensive renovation in June. But, dearly beloved, you may be gathered in <place>Minneapolis</place> to celebrate the life of one of its most famous sons: Prince. Since his untimely death in April, fans of the pop genius can paint the town purple: Take a tour of <place>First Avenue</place>, the club featured in the 1984 classic film “Purple Rain,” or go on a citywide Prince-themed tour with Waconiaville Tours. Most exciting, <place>Paisley Park</place>, Prince’s private domain for two decades, about 20 miles outside of town, has opened for public tours, allowing fans a look behind the purple veil.— David Farley
