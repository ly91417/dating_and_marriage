Case in point: <place>Dun Huang Plaza</place>, a four-building, two-story strip mall complex at 9889 <place>Bellaire</place>, just east of <place>Beltway</place>. With its long procession of cramped strip malls adjacent to but apart from one another, this <place>Chinatown</place> is paradoxically both dense and sprawling.

The variety of cuisines to choose from at lunch and dinner shows why "Asiatown" might be a more apt name than <place>Chinatown</place>. At <place>Dun Huang Plaza</place> alone, diners can choose from Japanese, Cantonese, Taiwanese, Hunan, Hong Kong, Vietnamese, Korean and Malaysian fare.

You'd be hard-pressed to find Hunan cuisine as spicy or authentic as what's on offer at <place>Hunan Bistro</place>. Bold diners can sample fish heads, frog legs, chicken feet and pork bellies, while those reluctant to make the complete leap over the Great Wall can tuck into more familiar fare like whole fish, beef, lamb, tofu and chicken.
Unless specified otherwise, be prepared for your mouth to be set alight with spices, and beware the numbing properties of Sichuan peppercorns, which despite the restaurant's Hunan designation, are in evidence in some dishes here.

Along with its famed hot pots with names like "Prosper at 5 a.m." and "Top Notch Pot of the Outlaws," Sichuan peppercorns are the stock in trade of <place>Mala Sichuan</place>, a few blocks east at 9348 <place>Bellaire</place>.

Dense with dining and shopping, too


Those in search of even more exotic regional Chinese fare can find it at <place>Uyghur Bistro</place>, which offers spicy halal kebabs, noodles and lamb dishes from China's Islamic far western Xinjiang Autonomous Region (9888 <place>Bellaire</place>, across the street from <place>Dun Huang Plaza</place>).
<place>Rival Malaysian</place> restaurants stare each other down across the <place> Dun Huang</place> parking lot -- the intimate <place>Banana Leaf</place> and the more imposing <place>Mamak</place>, which offers diners a window into the kitchen, where cooks toss roti dough overhead like pizza chefs. This naan-like crispy-on-the-outside, fluffy-on-the-inside roti bread is served as an appetizer to be dipped in curry sauces. 

Like most <place>Dun Huang</place> restaurants, <place>Mamak</place> offers lunch specials for under $7. Here that could get you okra and shrimp in Malaysian sauce, rendang beef or Hainanese chicken, each with a mound of rice.
While <place>Houston</place>'s 2014-era ramen craze has abated somewhat, <place>Dun Huang's Tiger Den</place> still draws crowds to its doors each day for its 5 p.m. opening. Throngs gather to poke their chopsticks in steaming bowls of miso, tantan and tonkotsu soups, while late-night visitors to Dun Huang flock to the bar at <place>GiAu Bar N' Bites</place>, an occasionally raucous Vietnamese lounge/tapas bar where the "avocado bomb" sushi roll has garnered a serious cult following.
Though famed primarily as a dining destination, <place>Dun Huang</place> offers a handful of prime shopping spots as well.
