The <place>Queen City</place>’s transformation is most evident in its <place>Over-the-Rhine district</place>, first settled by German immigrants in the 19th century. Once a dodgy neighborhood, it has renovated buildings and warehouses that are now apartments and offices for tech companies. On <place>Vine Street</place>, young brands like interiors shop <place>Elm</place> &amp; <place>Ironsit</place> alongside <place>Cincinnati institutions</place> like <place>Holtman’s Donuts</place>. There are larger changes throughout the city: the new Cincinnati Bell Connector street car links the northern fringes of OTR with downtown and the <place>Ohio River</place>, and <place>Ziegler Park</place>, with a deepwater pool and redesigned public spaces, will be unveiled this spring, followed by the reopening of the city’s historic <place>Music Hall</place> and the inaugural Blink Cincinnati light and art festival in October. Locals zip across state lines on a daily basis, and the best new place to bed down is actually a 10-minute drive across the river in <place>Covington</place>, <place>Kentucky</place>. The boutique <place>Hotel Covington</place> occupies the former headquarters of <place>Coppin’s Department Store</place>, and the original 1907 architecture serves its new purpose beautifully: upon entering, you get a sweeping view of reception, the lobby, and the bar with its 20-foot ceilings, thanks to a sloping floor originally designed to let shoppers see the entire department store when they walked through its <place>Madison Avenue</place> doors. Filmmakers are also increasingly drawn to Cincinnati, thanks to its <place>Art Deco</place> buildings and its tax incentives. Off-camera, Nicole Kidman, Colin Farrell, and Ellen Page have all been spotted dining in hot spots like Boca and Sotto and checking in to the art-filled 21C <place>Museum Hotel</place>.—Aoife O’Riordain
