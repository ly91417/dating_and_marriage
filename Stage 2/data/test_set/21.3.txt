One of the last old-school baseball stadiums in <place>America</place>, <place>Wrigley Field</place> is a place to experience the up-close joys of baseball, rather than the spectacle of oversize sport.

For years, journalist Carrie Kaufman worked nearby and still loves the experience.

"<place>Wrigley Field</place>, on a warm summer night when the breeze off <place>Lake Michigan</place> makes the flags flutter and your cheeks flush with relief from the damp heat.

"No matter where you sit, you are close to the field, which makes you feel both the intimacy of the game and the immensity of it.

"The players, standing just feet away from you, feel like giants. And the vendors in the stands hawking hot dogs and beers and Italian ice really are a study in that particular species of <place>Chicago</place> native."

<place>Wrigley Field</place> is such an evocative place, a paint brand has started selling a line of colors inspired by it.

Just outside <place>Valparaiso</place>, <place>Emiliana Organic Vineyards</place> create wines in a storybook fashion: on a wine farm where flowers and food crops grow as well as grapes, with alpacas, horses and geese in the fields.
It's the childhood image of a farm, except that this one produces award-winning wine.

In the world of organic farming, <place>Emiliana</place>'s approach is called biodynamic, because of the interplay between different species of plants and animals. For example, the chicken coops have wheels, so the hens can feed on insects all over the farm.

It's a beautiful setting to experience practical ways of working with the earth.
