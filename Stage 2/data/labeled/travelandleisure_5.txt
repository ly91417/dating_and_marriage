Beyond its iconic mountain backdrop and cinematic beaches, <place>Cape Town</place> has a compelling art and design scene, and it’s only going to get better when the <place>Zeitz Museum</place> of Contemporary African Art opens at the V&amp;A <place>Waterfront</place> in 2017. The MOCAA—heralded as <place>South Africa</place>’s answer to the MoMA or the Tate Modern—will take over a soaring concrete building once used for grain storage. Atop the museum sits The <place>Silo</place>, a luxury hotel from the <place>Royal Portfolio</place> that’s set to open in March. Until then, visitors can fill the hours between gallery-hopping with a taste of the legendary local fare. The surrounding <place>Cape Wine</place> lands—<place>Stellenbosch</place>, <place>Constantia</place>, and <place>Franschhoek</place>, among others—keep <place>Cape Town</place>’s residents well hydrated, while acclaimed restaurants like the <place>Test Kitchen</place>(ranked number 22 on the World’s 50 Best Restaurants list) and its new sister spot the <place>Shortmarket Club</place> keep them well fed. —Mary Holland
