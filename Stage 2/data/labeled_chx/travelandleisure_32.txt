After nearly 10 years of construction, the <place>Panama Canal</place> expansion has opened. Giant cruise ships—like the Caribbean Princess—can now pass through via the 180-foot-wide locks.Princess is one of the first lines to take advantage of this, with six sailings in 2017. On land, a sleek W Hotel will open downtown, and a new boutique property,<place>La Concordia</place>—where rooms have private balconies and claw-foot bathtubs—is near completion in historic <place>Casco Viejo</place>. Foran introduction to <place>Panama City</place>, book a tour with Black Tomato. They can arrange private helicopter rides or sailings around <place>Gatun Lake</place>. Best of all, <place>Panama</place> uses the U.S. dollar, making shopping easy. —Melanie Lieberman
