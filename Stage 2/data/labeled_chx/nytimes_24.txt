The <place>Algarve</place> may be chock a block with tourists and grand hotels, but hippie-chic <place>Comporta</place>, a protected nature reserve and former fisherman’s village in the <place>Alentejo</place> region, is deliberately underdeveloped and teeming with creative European A-listers. This year its only major hotel —<place>Sublime Comporta</place>,with rustic rooms and suites scattered across forests of pine, cork and olive — opened a restaurant, <place>Celeiro</place>, inspired by the area’s old rice barns, along with 22 luxury villas. Nearby, <place>A man Resorts</place> broke ground on a project that fell through, leaving locals buzzing about which big-name company will take up where they left off. Go before the branding happens.— Baz Dreisinger
