A surprising way of showing gratitude

In remote fishing communities across southeast <place>Alaska</place> live the intensely generous Tlingit and Haida tribes, a nation of matrilineal Native Alaskan Indians that have called this region – along with parts of Western <place>Canada</place> – home for more than 10,000 years.

Some of southeast <place>Alaska</place>’s tribes have lived in the area for more than 10,000 years.

Our motorboat left from the quaint yet burgeoning tourist-and-cruise hub of <place>Ketchikan</place>, <place>Alaska</place>, weaving past evergreen-covered mountains with their peaks obscured by the misty morning fog. We crossed vast deep-blue waters filled with cresting humpback whales, traversed golden kelp clusters and left behind wild islands that had no name.

Standing at the shore was a Native woman dressed in jeans and a thick wool sweater. She was all smiles and seemed genuinely happy to see us. She led us to Totem Park, the site for which the former fishing camp and cannery hub is now most famous, to see <place>Alaska</place>’s largest collection of authentic totem poles, currently numbered at 21. Originals and replicas towered far into the blue summer skies, and as if on cue, a bald eagle soared overhead. It felt like a very good omen.
