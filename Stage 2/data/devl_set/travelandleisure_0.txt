<place>Brazil</place>’s visa <place>waiver</place> during the Olympics was a <place>success</place> for one big reason: it encouraged travel beyond the big cities. The tourism board hopes to bring back the waiver, and if you’re planning to take advantage, save time to visit <place>Angra dos Reis</place>, between <place>Rioand São Paulo</place>. This popular Brazilian vacation area is where cariocas go to escape the crowds. “It’s where many of the country’s elite have their beach villas,” says Martin Frankenberg of <place>Matuete</place>, who has access to several of these glamorous rentals. Big changes are coming to the region. In May, Brazilian chain Fasano will open a long-awaited 54-suite hotel in a complex that includes a marina, golf course, restaurants, and a spa. The design is striking, with elevated wooden buildings that look like they’re floating, all with open-air terraces and views of the forest and sea. And the government recently pledged $8 million to improve the infrastructure on <place>Ilha Grande</place>—an island that’s so popular that they’ve had to impose a daily limit on visitors.—Stephanie Wu
