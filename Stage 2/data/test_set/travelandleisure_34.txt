It’s one of the most remote cities on earth, but that hasn’t stopped the capital of <place>Western Australia</place> from becoming a dining hot spot. Take <place>City Beach</place>, where the new restaurants have the best ocean views in town. The latest is the beautifully designed <place>Odyssea</place>—its veranda is a favorite for seafood and sundowners. <place>Elizabeth Quayis</place> a contemporary urban precinct on the <place>Swan River</place> that combines public spaces and art. There,the <place>Reveley</place> has three levels of modern Australian dining, including a roof top bar; and <place>Isle of Voyage</place>, in a restored historic kiosk, serves swank café fare like crab tagliatelle paired with local wines. The chicest cocktail bar in town is the <place>Waiting Room</place>, in the lobby of <place>Crown Towers</place>, the city’s new ultra-luxe, 513-room hotel. Design firm Bates Smart has taken inspiration from the glamour of <place>Manhattan</place> and <place>Palm Springs</place>, with lush jewel tones, a marble bar, and a sprawling terrace with vistas of the river and city skyline.—Carrie Hutchinson
