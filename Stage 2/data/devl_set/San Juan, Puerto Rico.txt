Chosen By: Sarah Greaves-Gabbadon, founder of Jet Set Sarah, where travel and shopping meet
Why: The best way to get a deal in the Caribbean is to travel during the low season (end of April through mid-December) to destinations that have direct and frequent fights from your gateway; plenty of hotel inventory; and economies that aren't euro-based. <place>Puerto Rico</place> fits the bill, and I'm a big fan of <place>San Juan</place>, which I think is seriously underrated as an easy and affordable getaway, especially for visitors from the <place>East Coast</place> of the <place>U.S.</place> <place>Old San Juan</place> oozes charm, and if you stay within the old city's two-square-mile radius you won't need a car rental to access great restaurants, sightseeing and shopping. <place>U.S.</place> citizens can save themselves the cost of a passport since it's not required to visit, and since the <place>U.S.</place> dollar is the legal tender, there's no money lost on currency exchange. <place>Hotel Casa Blanca</place> and <place>Villa Herencia</place> are two of my favorite high-style/low-cost boutique hotels.
