<place>Rural Croatia</place> is dotted by about 1,000 wineries.

<place>Croatia</place> may not be a name synonymous with wine, but it should be.

With wine-producing history dating back to around 2200 B.C., the industry flourished under the Greeks but was disrupted by the Ottoman invasion.

Things picked up again in 2010 with the creation of the Association of Croatian Wineries.

There are some 64 indigenous grape varieties producing Merlot, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon from the 1,000 or so wineries that scatter rural <place>Croatia</place>.

"Posip is the famous white wine from <place>Korcula Island</place>," says Tonci Nola, a manager at <place>Villa Dubrovnik</place>.

"A heavier option is the strong and bold-flavored Kuca Glavic from this <place>Dubrovnik Riviera</place>. Red-wine lovers should opt for <place>Tribidrag</place>, from the far north, for its powerful, full-bodied finish."

Fall is when the vineyards come alive and can be visited.

There's no shortage of restaurants with stellar views along the riviera, but only a few have food to match.

Among the best are <place>Nautika</place>'s outlets -- a distinctly Croatian group of waterfront and clifftop eateries.
