National parks can hire for summer, despite Trump freeze

Will <place>Grand Canyon</place>, <place>Yellowstone</place>, <place>Yosemite</place> and other national parks be closed to visitors this summer?

For the past week, that's been unclear after President Donald Trump announced a federal government hiring freeze that could've affected hires the <place>US National Park</place> Service depends on to serve millions of visitors during the high season.

Now, it seems, they're going to be able to open as usual.

Seasonal and short-term temporary employees "necessary to meet traditionally recurring seasonal workloads," have been given a break under a list of exemptions to the freeze issued Tuesday.
The NPS, which hosted a record-breaking 307.2 million visits in 2015, depends on some 8,000 temporary workers to keep the parks running during the summer high season, a park service spokesman confirmed.
Trump's federal hiring freeze had left park officials across the country wondering if they would still be able to start hiring in February and March for the summer season.

Now it appears they still can hire those seasonal employees.

"As long as the Department of Interior (which oversees the park service) gives advance notice to its OMB resource management office, the hiring of seasonal workers should be allowable," Coalter Baker, a US Office of Management and Budget spokesman, told CNN.

Seasonal employees are critical to the park service during the high season, NPS spokesman Tom Crosson told CNN.
