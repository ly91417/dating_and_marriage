Dining in <place>Madrid</place> is increasingly an international experience, with extraordinary and innovative <place>Japanese</place>, Brazilian, Vietnamese, Peruvian, Mexican or Indian cuisine. Among the most exciting new restaurants are <place>Sandro Silva</place>’s Amazónico(with Brazilian and Indian tandoori elements), <place>Dani Garcia</place>’s BiBoMadrid (an “Andalusian brasserie”), Chuka Ramen Bar(a Japanese take on Chinese street food) and <place>David Muñoz</place>’s DiverXO(a three-Michelin star melding of Ibero-Asiatic cuisines). And that is just A through D. All across town, markets and derelict buildings are being transformed into high-end food courts, like the gorgeous Platea in a former <place>Art Deco</place> cinema. Wash it all down with house-made spirits at <place>Macera</place>.— Andrew Ferren
