<place>Zermatt</place>, neighbor to the legendary <place>Matterhorn</place>, has been luring active travelers since 1898, when the <place>Gornergrat</place> train — <place>Switzerland</place>’s first electric cog rail — began operating. In time for the rail’s 200th anniversary, the five-star <place>Riffelalp Resort</place>, on the edge of a 7,290-foot-high plateau facing the <place>Matterhorn</place>, reopened in December with updated rooms and ski-in and ski-out access. Higher up, at <place>Riffelberg</place>, a permanentopen-air theater will open this summer with performances of “Romeo and Juliet on <place>Gornergrat</place>.”— Erin Levi
