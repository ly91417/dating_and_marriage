Along the <place>Urubamba River</place>, the luxe Chilean ecohotelier Explora has built a 50-room lodgeon an old maize plantation, <place>Hacienda Urubamba</place> is offering lessons in making maize beer, and the <place>Lima</place> restaurant <place>IK</place> opened the gastro inn <place>IFK Lodge</place>.
