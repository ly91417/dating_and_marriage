Long regardedas the country’s classic wine region, this year the area will gain fresh life with the addition of a number of hotels and restaurants, not to mention a new emphasis on bespoke beer from the <place>Fieldwork Brewery Company</place>,which opened in October (and joins five other breweries on this 29-mile strip of wine country). Meanwhile, <place>Las Alcobas</place>, a hotel designed by Yabu Pushelberg, will open its doors this month in <place>St. Helena</place>, and <place>Two Birds/One Stone</place> brings a yakitori-inspired dining spot to the area. Don’t miss a tasting at the new <place>JaMcellars</place>, which moonlights as a recording studio and bespoke fashion salon.— Ondine Cohane
