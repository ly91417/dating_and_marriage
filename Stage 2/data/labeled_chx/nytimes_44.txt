<place>Birmingham</place>’s nickname,“The <place>Pittsburgh</place> of the <place>South</place>,” seems apt anew, thanks to the revitalization of the <place>Avondale</place> neighborhood, where artists, restaurateurs and young entrepreneurs are taking over brick warehouses and <place>Queen Anne</place> cottages. Since the neighborhood’s eponymous brewery took up residence inside a 19th-century firehouse, hip hangouts like the wood-fired pizzeria <place>Post Office Pies</place>, the live music venue <place>Saturnand</place> the garage-turned-brunch hot spot <place>Rowe’s Service Station</place> have followed suit, with mainstays like <place>Saw's Soul Kitchen</place> still dishing it out.— Chaney Kwak
