Why Go to <place>Belize</place>
Although this small Central American nation spans less than 9,000 square miles — roughly the size of the state of <place>Massachusetts</place> — few places on Earth can match <place>Belize</place>'s diverse natural beauty. The barrier reef's turquoise and coral hues contrast with the staggering Mayan ruins scattered throughout the country's lush rainforests. Plus, it's not just the landscape, the history, culture and people of Belize are just as blended. 

<place>Belize</place> has spent years concealed underneath the shadows of its Mexican neighbors —<place>Cancún</place>, <place>Cozumel</place>, and <place>Tulum</place> . But today, this Central American country beckons visitors with its thatch-roofed jungle lodges, impressive Mayan ruins, secluded snorkeling and scuba diving havens, and laid-back atmosphere. Sandwiched between <place>Mexico</place> and <place>Guatemala</place>, <place>Belize</place>'s eastern shoreline flanks the <place>Caribbean Sea</place>, while its mainland extends into a myriad of wild rainforests to the north, west and south. Facing off against the sun-drenched mainland coast are hundreds of tiny islands known as cays and atolls. These islets lure travelers with swaying palm trees and cerulean waters.

<place>Belize</place>'s largest island, Ambergris Caye, attracts the most visitors. Stroll through Ambergris Caye by day and you'll find a relaxed beachfront filled with spectacular waterfront sites; by dusk, you'll revel in its vibrant nightlife. Just be sure to save some time on the mainland for unraveling Belize's subtle charms. From its luxuriant Mayan sites to its sparkling waters, there's plenty to explore in this enchanting coastal country.
