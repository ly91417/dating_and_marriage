When Saptarshi and I reached the dock from where the ferry departs to the mainland, the sun stretched lazily towards the water while wind-stirred trees nodded their approval. Nearby, Gyen, alone now, devotedly swept the village’s shrine to Dakshin Rai, for which he was appointed caretaker following his retirement from fishing.

An ominous low rumble shattered the serene scene as a monstrous freighter ploughed into view through the <place>Sundarbans</place>’ silent waters. Plumes of acrid smoke leaked from the tanker, staining the pink-hued sky a molten brown.

In late 2016, <place>Bangladesh</place> commenced construction of the country’s largest coal-power station just 65km upstream of the <place>Sundarbans</place> forest.

<place>Rampal Coal Power Station</place> has been met with universal condemnation by environmental organisations, including Unesco, who labelled it a “serious threat” to the <place>Sundarbans</place> ecosystem.

The organisation’s detailed report claims pollution from coal ash and waste water, as well as increased shipping and dredging, will accelerate the effects of climate change in the delicate region and cause “irreversible damage”.

Dr Punarbasu Chaudhuri, head of environmental sciences at Calcutta University, 70km north of the <place>Sundarbans</place>, agrees with Unesco’s prognosis, and worries about the potential widespread implications of the plant.

“About 2.5 million people are dependent on the mangroves of this region for their livelihood,” he said. “They, the tigers, the vegetation and all animals that rely on the area will suffer significantly if the ecosystem is permanently damaged. 

The area is threatened by the construction of the <place>Rampal Coal Power Station</place>, only 65km away.

Though <place>Bangladesh</place> government officials maintain the plant will have no detrimental effects on the forest, both Chaudhuri and Unesco conclude that the project should be moved or scrapped completely.
