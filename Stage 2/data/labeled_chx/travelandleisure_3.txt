After being hit hard by the financial crisis, <place>Bermudais</place> shaking itself out of stagnation and attracting a new generation of travelers. In 2014, the island won a bid to host the 35th America’s Cup, the high-profile international sailing race, which takes place this June. The promise of a flood of wealthy visitors—and a loosening of restrictions on foreign investment—has sparked a spate of development. Big news is the $100 million overhaul of the <place>Hamilton Princess</place>; <place>Beach Club</place>, the island’s 132-year-old grande dame, whose revamped rooms have a fresh, contemporary look. The hotel has also added a stellar art collection, a spa, and a restaurant serving locally sourced fare from James Beard Award–winning chef Marcus Samuelsson. Elsewhere on the island, at <place>St. Regis</place>, a lavish <place>Ritz-Carlton Reserve</place>, and the <place>Ariel Sands</place> resort (backed by actors Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones) are in the works.—Paola Singer
