Only 10 minutesby ferry from the mainland, this four-mile-long under-the-radar Mediterranean island is an unexplored refuge with mountain-biking trails, sandy beaches and a single rustic vineyard offering free daily wine tastings. Mostly national parkland, the car-free island has one idyllic village where you’ll hear the clinking of both pétanque boules and glasses of pastis. The place to stay is <place>Le Mas du Langoustier</place>, an upscale hotel perched between two coves on the western end of the island.— Ingrid K. Williams
