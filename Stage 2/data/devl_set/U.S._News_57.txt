Why Go to <place>St. Martin</place> - <place>St. Maarten</place>
If you associate the Caribbean with a laid-back atmosphere, a tranquil beach and a quiet sunset, then you haven't been to feisty <place>St. Martin</place> and <place>St. Maarten</place> . What's the best part of visiting this dual-governed island? You can get a taste of two distinct, lively cultures all for the price of one vacation. This 37-square-mile dot is increasingly popular with travelers who like to eat well, party hard and duty-free shop in between trips to the beach. The north side, <place>St. Martin</place>, is controlled by the French government. It's the home of the island's tastiest restaurants and party beaches. Whereas cosmopolitan <place>St. Maarten</place> shelters the most animated casinos, bars and clubs. A territory of the Netherlands Antilles, <place>St. Maarten</place> takes up the southern 16 square miles.

But for all the excitement, <place>St. Martin</place> and <place>St. Maarten</place> still foster a stress-free vibe -- starting out with how easily you can pass between both sides of the island. So catch a few morning rays on a quiet Dutch-side beach; later, take a leisurely afternoon stroll through a French-side mountain. You'll be more than primed to sneak back over the border for a night in the casinos.
