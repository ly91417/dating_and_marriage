Why Go to <place>Jamaica</place>
To many, <place>Jamaica</place> is the heart of the Caribbean. The birthplace of reggae music, the Rastafari movement and all-inclusive resorts, Jamaica symbolizes many of the things most loved and, perhaps, most misunderstood about the region. A simple remedy to clear the confusion? Come to the land of sugar cane, coffee and limestone, and form your own opinion. Your new ideas are bound to be swathed in cream-colored beaches, bordered by rugged Blue Mountains, anchored in foamy waterfalls and set to a dancehall soundtrack.

Most who travel here don't leave the comforts of their all-inclusive resort; those who do typically don't venture too far outside their immediate area. As the third-largest island of the Caribbean, Jamaica is hard to cover in one trip. Rather, it's best to choose your activities and vacation priorities, then make your hotel plans accordingly. Of the three main tourist pockets on the island, westernmost Negril is popular for its beaches and upscale accommodations; northwestern <place>Montego Bay</place> is well-liked by golfers; and <place>Ocho Rios</place> in the northeast appeals most to adventurous types. Some (but not many) visitors choose the eastern area of <place>Port Antonio</place> to try the top-notch surfing at <place>Boston Bay Beach</place>, the hiking along the <place>Blue Mountains</place> and the river rafting along the <place>Rio Grande</place> .
