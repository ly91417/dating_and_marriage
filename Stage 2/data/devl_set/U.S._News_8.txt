Why Go to <place>Washington, D.C.</place>
With its marbled monuments and high-profile politicos, <place>Washington, D.C.</place>, has long been saddled with a reputation as a stuffy government-driven town. A "city of southern efficiency and northern charm," as John F. Kennedy once described it, Washington is often seen by outsiders as slow and inefficient. But these days, our nation's capital is awash with a new energy, transforming itself into an exciting, faster-paced East Coast vacation destination. Although government is still the sun around which this city orbits, the District also offers a host of renowned museums and interesting neighborhoods. And with a recent explosion of restaurants, cafes, boutique shops and clubs,<place> D.C.</place> is transitioning into a thriving cultural hub. As the <place>D.C.</place> Tourism Board is emphasizing through its "DC Cool" campaign, this isn't the Washington you remember from your middle school field trip — it's much hipper than that.

You can choose a traditional D.C. adventure, filled with tours of classic attractions like the White House and the Washington Monument, and the <place>Smithsonian's Natural History Museum</place> . And there's no better way to experience iconic D.C. than with a stroll around the Tidal Basin. (Plan to visit in late March or early April —just in time for the National Cherry Blossom Festival — and you'll be rewarded with a canopy of beautiful pink blooms.) But if you've already seen the national landmarks, get a feel for the city's more youthful ambiance, highlighted by its urban neighborhoods, marquee art galleries and vibrant farmers' markets. Follow foodies to Eastern Market, where Capitol Hill residents shuffle through stands for the freshest produce and trendiest clothing (before working their way through a mile-high stack of pancakes). Afterward, peruse the high-end stores peppering Georgetown or rub shoulders with savvy Washingtonians at the many bars and music joints crowding the <place>U Street Corridor</place> . While you'll only need a few days to see the city as you know it from your history book, it could take months to experience the Washington that today's locals know and love.
