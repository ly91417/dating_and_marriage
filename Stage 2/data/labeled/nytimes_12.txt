The earthquake that rattled <place>Ecuador</place> last year mostly shattered areas where international travelers seldom go. Now man-made threats may compromise <place>El Pedregal</place>, a popular place for visitors before or after <place>Galápagos</place> excursions. The valley south of <place>Quito</place> is surrounded by huge volcanoes and grassy steppes where haciendas serve as bases for travelers to go hiking, mountain biking and horseback riding. Go before June to see the valley before new power lines encroach on condors and views.— Tim Neville
