Why Go to <place>Turks & Caicos</place>

This network of 40 islands and cays has three dominant personalities. There's glamorous Providenciales, or "Provo," which acts as the main port for the cruise ship crowd and site of many luxurious hotels. Laid-back Grand Turk is the historic and cultural nucleus, best seen in the <place>Turks & Caicos National Museum</place> or along the shores of <place>Cockburn Town</place>, where Christopher Columbus first docked in the Western Hemisphere.
