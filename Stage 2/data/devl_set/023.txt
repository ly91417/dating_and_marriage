Today or tomorrow <place>Houston</place>'s <place>Chinatown</place>: Spicing it up, Asian-Cajun style

In addition to fresh fish, <place>Hong Kong Food Market</place> carries teas, sauces, cooking pastes, instant ramen and addictive powdered Vietnamese iced coffee.
<place>Houston</place>, <place>Texas</place> (CNN)When you hear the word "<place>Chinatown</place>," you probably think of the 19th-century buildings and steep-graded streets of <place>San Francisco</place>, or the steaming manhole covers of chilly <place>New York City</place>: compact but dense areas packed with pedestrians accessed via ornate Far Eastern gateways.

That is not what you will find in <place>Houston</place>'s <place>Chinatown</place>, a vast, rectangular, city-within-a-city 12 miles southwest of downtown, sprawling along <place>Bellaire Boulevard</place> from <place>Fondren Road</place> on the east to Highway 6 on the west, and extending north roughly to <place>Westpark Drive</place> and south to <place>Beechnut Street</place>.

Instead of converted Victorian tenements, think brand-new strip malls (and even a 1970s-style enclosed mall), postwar Levittown-style ranch houses and 1970s office parks and apartment complexes. From the air, it looks like any other automobile-friendly shopping district. But oh, what a difference when you are the ground.

There is some debate as to whether "<place>Chinatown</place>" suffices to encompass the multitude of Asian cultures visitors will find within its boundaries.

Yes, the street signs along <place>Bellaire Boulevard</place> from <place>South Gessner</place> to roughly <place>Beltway</place> are posted in Mandarin characters as well as English script, but go further west and they change to Vietnamese. (The Chinese name for <place>Bellaire</place> translates to "Hundreds of Profits," while the Vietnamese have renamed the same street Saigon Boulevard.)

And while those two cultures are easily the most visible in the roughly six-square-mile area, they are far from the only ones you will find.
