<place>Penzance</place>, the Cornish port town in the southwest of <place>England</place>, is having a moment, thanks to the popularity of “Poldark,” the BBC costume drama set in 18th-century Cornwall. The new <place>Chapel House</place> joins a local favorite, the <place>Artists Residence</place>, while restaurants such as the <place>Tolcarne Inn</place>, in nearby <place>Newlyn</place>, and the <place>Shore</place> have put <place>Penzance</place> on the map as a culinary destination. Perhaps the best thing to see in <place>Penzance</place> — aside from the scenery — is the Art Deco-inspired <place>Jubilee</place> pool, one of <place>Europe</place>’s last salt water lidos. The enormous triangular public pool was built in the 1930s and just underwent a $3.73 million renovation.— David Shaftel
