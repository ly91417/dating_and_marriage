As a gateway to the <place>Galápagos</place>, <place>Guayaquil</place> has seen its fair share of overnight visitors en route to the islands. But additions to the tropical port city are enticing travelers to stay longer. The just-opened <place>Hotel del Parque</place> sets a new standard in the city, with 44 elegant rooms in a restored 19th-century colonial complex that also includes a riverside restaurant. The massage-treatment room is in a repurposed bell tower atop the property’s original chapel, an airy mix of Gothic and Mediterranean styles where mass is still held. And the hotel’s setting on the seven-acre <place>Parque Histórico Guayaquil</place> makes it easy for guests to explore a wildlife sanctuary, historic structures, and a former cacao plantation. See modern <place>Guayaquil</place> when you visit the <place>Malecón</place> 2000, the city’s revitalized riverfront promenade lined with plazas, playgrounds, monuments, galleries, gardens, and two fantastic museums. Go at night for the best view, when the <place>Ferris wheel—Ecuador</place>’s newest toy—is backed by the twinkling lights above the hillside village of <place>Las Penas</place>.—Nina Kokotas Hahn
