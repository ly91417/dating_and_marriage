Why Go to <place>Barcelona</place>
<place>Barcelona</place> contains both the authentically historic and the wildly bizarre. From the tree-lined Las Ramblas to the narrow alleys of <place>Barri Gòtic</place>; from the beachside nightclubs to the city's dozens of sacred churches and cathedrals, this city by the sea seems to attract all types: the family, the adventurer, the couple, the backpacker, the culture lover — and more — with an almost overwhelming variety of things to do. You could stay for a few days, but chances are you'll need a whole week to explore.

In <place>Barcelona</place>, even the beach is bustling, but it's really the cosmopolitan city that gets all the attention. Much of the activity revolves around Las Ramblas, a series of narrow streets and alleys packed with restaurants, nightclubs and a vibrant pedestrian market. But you should also take a tour of Antoni Gaudí's masterpieces; <place>Gaudí</place> is responsible for sites like Parc Güell, Casa Batlló and La Sagrada Familia. And it would also be absurd to miss out on the eclectic shopping scene and the region's exquisite food and wine. Do you see why we suggest a week vacation?
