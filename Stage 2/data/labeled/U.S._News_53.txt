Why Go to <place>Curacao</place>
The "C" in the <place>ABC islands</place>, Curaçao features historic settlements, rugged landscapes and plenty of fun in the sun. <place>Curaçao</place>'s main port city, <place>Willemstad</place>, is what an Old World European city would look like if someone dropped it in the Caribbean. The brightly painted Dutch colonial buildings reflect pinks, yellows and blues into the cerulean <place>St. Anna Bay</place> . Once you leave the city, the landscape shifts to a desert scene, with spiny aloe and mesquite sprouting from atop weathered limestone cliffs.

But <place>Curaçao</place>'s real draw is the beach. Picture-perfect bays and coves flank the island, their turquoise waters lapping gently against powdery white sand. Curaçao's reefs teem with marine life, providing excellent underwater playgrounds for scuba divers and snorkelers. Best of all, the semi-arid island is sheltered from the worst of the <place>Atlantic</place>'s hurricane season. Gentle trade winds keep temperatures in the mid-80s, so you can enjoy the outdoors year-round.
