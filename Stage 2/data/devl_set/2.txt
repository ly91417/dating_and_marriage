A pure land inspired by treachery

During the days of the samurai, Feudal <place>Japan</place> was like Game of Thrones in real life, with countless tales of familial betrayal and revenge, political intrigue and empires won and lost.

That’s why Fujiwara no Kiyohira, who lived in Japan’s northeastern region of <place>Tohoku</place> from 1056 to 1128, is especially admirable. Despite losing his father, wife and a child due to treachery, Fujiwara decided to break the cycle of bloodshed and to use his immense wealth for peace rather than warfare.

Establishing headquarters in the village of <place>Hiraizumi</place>, he devoted the last decades of his life to creating a Buddhist heaven on Earth, where the souls of friends and enemies, both human and animal, could find consolation and live in harmony. His son and grandson added to Fujiwara's vision with even more gardens, temples and pagodas, spreading <place>Hiraizumi</place>’s reputation throughout <place>Japa</place>n and as far away as <place>China</place>.

In 1189, after only 100 years of peaceful reign under three Fujiwara generations, the Buddhist utopia was attacked by warlord Minamoto no Yoritomo in his successful quest to become shogun and establish his military dictatorship in <place>Kamakura</place>, a town not far from present-day <place>Tokyo</place>.

Over the ensuing centuries, neglect and fire ravaged <place>Hiraizumi</place>’s magnificent wooden buildings. In fact, <place>Hiraizumi</place> may well be the most important Japanese village you’ve never heard of.
