If you’ve seen an African wildlife documentary in the last 30 years, chances are good that the filmmakers Dereck and Beverly Joubert had a hand in it. This spring the Jouberts, National Geographic explorers in residence, along with the company <place>Great Plains</place> Conservation, will open <place>Duba Plains</place> Camp, a luxury tented camp in a private 77,000-acre portion of the <place>Okavango Delta</place> that’s rife with lions, elephants and species specific to northern <place>Botswana</place> like the red lechwe. Expect safaris on boats with built-in camera mounts (when water levels allow) and a chance to see the descendants of Ma di Tau, the star of “The Last Lions.”— Tim Neville
