In 1999, Colin was elected as village representative and began what would become a lifelong mission: to resurrect the island. For the first few years, he focused on building a network of villagers from around the world, hoping to create a like-minded community of descendants and volunteers who would help to rebuild <place>Yim Tin Tsai</place> in a sustainable way.

Together with a committee of about 10 former villagers, Colin raised money to build a visitor centre for travellers. In 2004, a charitable foundation donated funds through the Catholic Church to renovate the island’s historical chapel. Originally built in 1890 by Catholic missionaries, it’s one of the oldest of its kind in <place>Hong Kong</place>.

Simple and elegant, the egg-white chapel features radiant stained-glass windows and an intimate prayer hall. A few rows of wooden pews face a minimalist altar, dressed up in red and gold accents. In 2005, Unesco Asia-Pacific Heritage Awards for Culture Heritage Conservation honoured the chapel with an award of merit.

Motivated by the recognition, the villagers organised a regular ferry schedule to enable travellers to reach the island, and set out to showcase the village’s unique history. They built a heritage trail, renovated Hakka ancestral homes, created a homewares and ceramics museum, and even started an organic farm that sits at the foot of the church.

“I want to make the island like a living museum,” Colin said. “Ten years ago, people weren’t really thinking about heritage and preservation. They wanted to make money and build high rises. But now people are taking notice.”

Salt of the Earth
After a string of successful renovations, the committee turned their focus to the island’s old salt pans. What was just a dusty dirt field a decade ago is now a fully functioning salt pan, complete with an educational visitor centre that explains each step of the salt production process.

In 2015, the resurrected salt fields earned a Unesco distinction for conserving this industrial <place>Hong Kong</place> heritage, estimated to date back more than 2,000 years.

Today the salt pans sparkle in the sunlight, surrounded by graceful mangrove trees. They don’t produce enough salt to be commercially viable, but as the only functioning salt pans in <place>Hong Kong</place>, they act as a nostalgic link to the past.
