Why: In <place>South Africa</place>, the exchange rate is in our favor, but so is the fact that it's a developed tourist destination with a solid infrastructure. In spending a month in Cape Town earlier this year and relying on Uber to get me to and from meetings, activities and lunches, I averaged under $20 in transportation per day â€” a major win. Hotels are cheaper, too: Take a standard room at <place>Taj Hotels & Resorts</place> in <place>New York</place> , and you are out about $786 a night, whereas in <place>Cape Town<place> , a room at a similar luxury property costs $266. Remember, <place>South Africa</place> is in the <place>Southern Hemisphere</place>, so seasons are the opposite: Consider going in low season (our summer) when hotels and safari lodges are even less expensive. Airbnb and private villa rentals are also reliable and cheap options in the major cities. Travelers should also consider booking domestic airfare in advance for the greatest cost savings, since flights on South African Airways can sell out quickly. The best value of all is the wine: Travelers can order a glass of one of the best locally produced varietals for less than the cost of a can of soda.
