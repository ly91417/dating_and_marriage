Why Go to <place>Santiago</place>
You might associate <place>Santiago</place> with towering skyscrapers, rolling vineyards and soaring mountains — and you wouldn't be wrong. Set in the Maipo Valley (framed by the snowy Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west), <place>Santiago</place> captivates visitors with its arresting views, neoclassical architecture and imaginative cuisine. <place>Santiago</place> hasn't always been so alluring: In its nearly 500-year history, the city has withstood invasions, dictatorships and earthquakes. But over the past few decades, an economic boom has helped Santiago reinvent its image and earn it a place on the tourism map alongside other popular South American destinations like Buenos Aires and <place>Rio de Janeiro</place> . Today, <place>Santiago</place> continues to evolve with Latin American character and European flair shaping its art-centric barrios (neighborhoods). Along Santiago's streets, you'll find centuries-old mansions and grand cathedrals jostling against cutting-edge shops and trendy galleries, markers of Santiago's textured past and present.

To discover the city's flourishing enclaves, shop alongside fashion-savvy Santiaguinos in Bellavista, soak in the scenery from Santa Lucía Hill or sit down for a meal in the Barrio Italia. Afterward, wander through the Plaza de Armas to the Metropolitan Cathedral or admire Pre-Columbian artifacts on display at the <place>Chilean Museum of Pre-Columbian Art</place> . And as the sun goes down, savor leisurely sips of a pisco sour at a cocktail bar or stay up late to join in the revelry at one of the many nightclubs strewn across the city. You may not see all of <place>Santiago</place>'s creativity and culture in one trip, but it won't take much effort to experience what's important: artsy boutiques, regionally inspired cuisine and delectable wine — local passions that are bringing a new luster to Chile's capital.
