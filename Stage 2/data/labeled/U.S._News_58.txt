Why Go to <place>St. Vincent</place> & <place>The Grenadines</place>
Imagine it: Thatched-roof cottages rise over turquoise waters; the sweet scent of tropical flowers and rum punch fills the air; bronzed sun-worshippers sprawl along isolated white-sands, hemmed by shimmering waves, coral reefs, and sleek yachts. The only thing luring you away from your beach towel is the intriguing network of secluded islands floating in the distance. Welcome to <place>St. Vincent</place> & <place>The Grenadines</place> .

If you don't want to spend your days sunning along one picturesque isle (<place>St. Lucia</place>) or savoring conch with throngs of tourists on two (<place>St. Kitts & Nevis</place>), then you should venture to <place>St. Vincent & The Grenadines</place>. With 32 remote islands and cays boasting emerald hills, postcard-worthy harbors, and boutique hotels, this Caribbean destination makes a perfect escape. Devote a few days to exploring St. Vincent, the biggest island of the chain, before sailing to <place>Mustique</place>, <place>Canouan</place>, and Bequiaâ€”some of the <place>Grenadine</place>'s finest (and exclusive) hideaways. However, exploring this quiet, less-traveled tropical paradise requires many hours in transit (there's no direct flight from the U.S.) and a thick wallet.
