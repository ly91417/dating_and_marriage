Why Go to <place>Charleston</place>
Centuries-old mansions, Spanish moss-draped trees, spooky cemeteries, cobblestone walks: in a word, <place>Charleston<place>. As you walk the gas lamp-lit streets at night, past horse-drawn carriages and the antebellum architecture, you just might think you've traveled back in time. But just because this South Carolina city is proud to celebrate its heritage doesn't mean it's stuck in the past: Charleston boasts innovative restaurants, interesting shops, contemporary art galleries and the world-class Spoleto Festival USA. This is the place to experience the genteel South — after all, it was the home of suave "Gone with the Wind" character, Rhett Butler.

History pervades almost every aspect of the Holy City, from the majestic homes-turned-museums to the landmarks that promote the city's role in United States history. Civil War buffs should head to Fort Sumter, where the first shot of the War between the States was fired. Meanwhile, shopaholics looking for locally made goods should peruse the Charleston City Market. When you're ready for a day at the beach, the city's got you covered there, too. Several beach towns, including <place>Sullivan's Island</place>, <place>Isle of Palm</place> and <place>Folly Beach</place>ß, offer sun, sand and gentle waves.
