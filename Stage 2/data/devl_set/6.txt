A high-speed getaway like no other

I stepped away from the check-in desk, boarding pass in hand. My flight was scheduled to depart <place>Shanghai</place> in just more than two hours, but instead of heading to the gates, I turned to walk away.

If I timed it right, there was a chance for one last adventure before I left <place>China</place>. I wanted to ride the fastest commercial train on the planet.

<place>Shanghai</place>'s magnetic levitation train connects <place>Pudong International Airport</place> to the city's metro system, hitting speeds of 430kph, faster than one-third of the speed of sound. As one of the few publicly accessible maglevs in the world, it’s a technological wonder you'd expect to find in a theme park, not on a transit map.

The train station sits in the middle of <place>Pudong International Airport</place>.

It took several minutes to reach the station, where I found a ticket machine and surveyed my options. A roundtrip cost 80 yuan, much less than a pass for <place>Shanghai Disneyland</place>, I reasoned. There was even a first class option, but I passed it up, figuring that on the world's most advanced train, economy is hardly slumming it.

If everything went as promised, I would rocket 30km away from my boarding gate. When I arrived at the <place>Longyang Road</place> station less than eight minutes later, the idea was to exit and immediately catch the next train back. If all went as planned, the entire 60km round-trip would take less than 20 minutes.

If not, there was going to be an interesting conversation with an airline representative explaining why I had my missed my flight.

The train immediately accelerated, and, like a high-tech drag racer, it kept accelerating. In no time, the speedometer reached 100kph, then 200. With each milestone, the carriage grew more animated. I’d expected my fellow travellers to be nonchalant, flipping through their smartphones and ignoring the marvel of the trip. Instead they were giddy as school children.
