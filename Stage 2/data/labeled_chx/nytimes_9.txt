<place>Zaha Hadid</place>’s meandering promenade along the <place>Elbe</place> recently breathed new life into the riverfront and the nearby 19th-century <place>Warehouse District</place>, which made the Unesco World Heritage list in 2015. Adding to the sheen, the much-anticipated Herzog; de Meuron-designed <place>Elbphilharmonie</place> is scheduled to open this month. The 360-foot-tall glass structure sits atop an old warehouse, its spiky roof evoking sails and the city’s maritime past. And if all that architectural gawking tires you out, the uber-luxurious <place>Fontenay</place> will open later this year, the first five-star hotel in this northern German city in 18 years.— David Farley
