A handful of <place>New York City</place> exiles are defying the island’s troubles and turning the tiny surf town of <place>Isabela</place> into a hot spot that draws those escaping the <place>East Coast</place> winter. The <place>Brooklyn</place>-raised chef Wilson Davalos launched the chic, 20-seat restaurant <place>CLMDO</place> in 2014, which sparked a host of other ventures. Highlights include <place>La Central</place>, a lively craft cocktail bar, and the just-opened branch of a <place>Rockaway Beach</place> favorite,<place>Uma</place>’s, a small resort that comprises a beachfront restaurant and surf shop with rooms for rent.— Nell McShane Wulfhart
