<place>Germany</place>’s favorite fast food

It’s nearly impossible to visit <place>Germany</place> and not eat Currywurst or Bratwurst, two ubiquitous sausage dishes. But regardless of the sausage’s fame, it seems that <place>Germans</place> can’t get enough of the döner kebab.

The nation of 82 million people consumes two million kebabs a day, according to Gürsel Ülber, spokesman for the Association of Turkish Döner Producers in <place>Europe</place> (ATDiD). Safe to say, the thinly sliced meat – cooked on a vertical spit, wrapped in pita or flatbread and topped with salad – overrules the sausage-duo as a preferred fast-food option; a prominent symbol of the cultural and economic influence of Turkish immigration on German society.

Kadir Nurman and Mehmet Aygun are the two men credited for its invention in <place>Berlin</place> nearly 50 years ago. Both were part of the Gastarbeiter, a wave of guest workers brought in from Southern and Eastern <place>Europe</place> to boost West <place>Germany</place>’s post-war economy. And that they did, paving the way for a 200,000-strong workforce today.

As I walked through the <place>Frankfurt</place>’s thriving financial district, I was amazed to see just how many choices there were for eating it, from fancy restaurants to little cafes fitted with beautiful Turkish décor. As the lunch-time rush kicked in on a busy Friday afternoon, locals, business people and tourists alike flocked to their nearest kebab eatery, happily waiting in long lines for a satisfying feed.
