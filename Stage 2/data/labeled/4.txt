<place>Taiwan</place>
A welcoming culture with warm people, along with the creature comforts of Western living, makes adjusting to life in <place>Taiwan</place> easy for most expats – especially since locals are always willing to help.

“I was surprised and humbled by the extent many Taiwanese locals were so openly welcoming, from showing patience when I jumbled up my Mandarin to going out of their way to help when I was in a bind,” said Monica Mizzi, originally from <place>Australia</place>, who runs the local events and culture blog Typing to <place>Taipei</place>. “Most expats congregate in <place>Taipei</place>, where more people speak English and transportation is easy,” she added.

Within the city itself, new expats tend to live in <place>Tienmu</place>. “It’s a sprawling ‘foreigner district’ with a more suburban feel, further removed from the MRT system,” explained Lizzie Gerock, originally from <place>Oklahoma</place> City, who now volunteers as an InterNations Consul in <place>Taipei</place>. Gerock, who’s been living in <place>Taipei</place> for several years, resides in the downtown district of <place>Xinyi</place> and “loves having access to shopping, restaurants, exhibitions, street performers, movies.”

“Buying anything foreign like appliances, food, clothes or shoes can be pricey,” said Karen Farley, an InterNations member originally from <place>Canada</place>. Prospective residents should also realise that having a Western-style large kitchen with oven is rare; most are small with a toaster oven or microwave.

<place>Malta</place>
Warm weather and proximity to <place>Europe</place> are the big draws for this Mediterranean nation. The climate leads to a slower pace of life, so prospective residents should get ready to relax instead of rush.

“Some shops have a ‘siesta’ early in the afternoon, and many people notice slow service at the restaurants,” said Silvia Di Felice, an InterNations Consul originally from <place>Rome</place>. “I remember sitting at a table around 8 pm once and leaving at midnight! We only had a starter and one main. Not all restaurants are like that, but be prepared; it's a relaxed approach to work.”

The towns of <place>Saint Julian</place>’s and <place>Sliema</place>, both located on the eastern coast, draw people who want to be near restaurants and nightlife. For those looking for more a more country, laidback lifestyle, Di Felice recommends the capital <place>Valletta</place>; <place>Naxxar</place>, 12km northwest of <place>Valletta</place>; and <place>Birgu</place>, 9km south of <place>Valletta</place>.

“I already have two favourite local wines here in <place>Malta</place>: a lovely white Cittadella and a red Caravaggio Merlot,” Di Felice said.

While <place>Malta</place>’s foreigner-friendly tax system is appealing to many expats (with no tax on capital gains earned from overseas and other preferential treatment), rent can be high. 

<place>Ecuador</place>
Friendly people, affordable healthcare and tasty, cheap food are just a few reasons as to why expats love living in <place>Ecuador</place>, according to the survey. Plus, the country’s diverse cities give expats a multitude of options.

“The beauty of <place>Ecuador</place> is the variety,” said Hagai Gat, an InterNations ambassador, originally from <place>Israel</place> who now lives in <place>Guayaquil</place>. “The people who come to retire in <place>Ecuador</place> often look for a lower cost of living, so the coastline, the southern part of <place>Ecuador</place> and <place>Ambato</place> [a city 150km south of <place>Quito</place>] will fit this type of expat. In the case of business-minded or outgoing expats, <place>Quito</place>, <place>Guayaquil</place> and <place>Cuenca</place> are the cities to live in.” The bigger cities do come at a cost, Gat warned, with higher prices for rent and eating out.
