Why Go to <place>Cozumel</place>
<place>Cozumel</place>'s clear turquoise waters and powdery sands coax travelers from cold winter climates to this 250-square-mile island off the <place>Yucatán Peninsula</place> . Cruise ships are a constant feature of <place>Cozumel</place>'s coastal views, and the atmosphere on this charming island is often interrupted by tourist chatter. In fact, <place>Cozumel</place>'s charms are so effective that the shopping plazas along the waterfront stay congested much of the year. But crowds shouldn't deter you from discovering what this tiny Yucatán island has to offer, especially as <place>Cozumel</place>'s real allure is far away from the downtown area. You can hire a fishing or diving charter boat to discover the shallow reefs along the coast (this is arguably one of the best diving destinations in the world), take a glass-bottom boat on a tour around the island or simply find a quiet beach where you can relax and do nothing. Once the cruise ships clear out, you should head down to the plaza for some live music and the real skinny on this little island.
