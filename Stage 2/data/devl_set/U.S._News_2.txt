Why Go to <place>Maui</place>
Maui is not nearly as large as the <place>Big Island</place>, nor is it as small as <place>Lanai</place>, as bustling as <place>Oahu</place> or as quiet as <place>Kauai</place> . For many <place>Hawaii</place> vacationers, <place>Maui</place> is just right — offering a taste of just about everything the <place>Aloha State</place> has to offer, from impressive wildlife to intriguing history and culture. While on a visit here, you can shimmy alongside professional hula dancers, golf along coastal fairways, snorkel alongside five different types of sea turtles or simply lounge along some of <place>Hawaii</place>'s most notable beaches.

One of the archipelago's most popular tourism spots, Maui can be found sandwiched between the <place>Big Island</place>. and the much tinier Molokai. Maui is divided into five distinct regions: Many travelers base themselves along the coasts of <place>South Maui</place> (home to the famous Wailea Beach) or <place>West Maui</place>, where the sands of <place>Kaanipali Beach</place> and the music from the <place>Old Lahaina Luau</place> are located. But the rest of the island should not be missed. Travel along the Road to Hana to experience <place>East Maui</place>'s scenic coastline, explore <place>Haleakala</place> — the world's largest dormant volcano — in the Upcountry, and explore the former tribal battlegrounds of Central <place>Maui's Iao Valley State Park</place> .
