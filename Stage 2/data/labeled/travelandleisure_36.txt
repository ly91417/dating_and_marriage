A new airport in the port town of <place>Pisco</place> is making access to coastal <place>Peru</place>’s top attractions easier than ever. It’s shortened the journey to the <place>Nazca Lines</place>, the 2,000-year-old geoglyphs that are best spotted from a plane, as well as the <place>Paracas National Reserve</place>, a protected swath of desert and marine habitat where visitors can see colonies of sea lions and the occasional group of Humboldt penguins. The lush oasis of <place>Huacachina</place>, in the neighboring <place>Ica</place> province, is a popular day trip for high-speed buggy rides over the surrounding sand dunes. <place>Pisco</place>’s namesake brandy is on tap in the region’s tasting rooms—including one at the oldest distillery in the Americas—andvineyard hotels. —Nicholas Gill
