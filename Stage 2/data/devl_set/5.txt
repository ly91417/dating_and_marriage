<place>India</place>’s ancient engineering marvel

Hidden in plain sight, just minutes away from the bustle of <place>New Delhi</place>’s commercial hub, Connaught Place, is an ancient landmark unknown even to most locals.

<place>Agrasen ki baoli</place> is a 14th-century stepwell (known as baoli or baori), a unique architectural idea that was medieval <place>India<place>’s ingenious answer to perennial water shortage. 

As I stood at the top of the 104 steps descending into the depths of the Earth at <place>Agrasen ki baoli</place>, I could see the high-rise city buildings in the backdrop, their white facades pesenting a stunning contrast to the russet bricks disappearing into the dark. The steps were enclosed on three sides by tall walls decorated with arches, niches and passageways, none of it giving any idea of what lay underground.
