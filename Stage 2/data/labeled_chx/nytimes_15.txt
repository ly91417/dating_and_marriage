Free state-owned museums will make visits to <place>Sweden</place>’s capital less expensive in 2017. Over a dozen dropped their hefty entry fees last year, including the <place>Museum of Modern Art</place>, the <place>Museum of Natural History</place>, the <place>Swedish History Museum</place> and <place>Skokloster Castle</place>. Add to that a favorable exchange rate for Americans — the krona is about 20 percent weaker against the dollar than it was two years ago — and this beautiful city suddenly looks even more attractive.— Ingrid K.
