Why Go to <place>Grenada</place>
It isn't the cost of the airfare or the caliber of the hotel that you'll remember most about your trip to <place>Grenada</place> . It's the kaleidoscope of reds, yellows, and greens that characterize <place>St. George</place>'s harbor (arguably the most beautiful in the Caribbean) and how they're reflected in the cerulean water. It's the sound of the waves lapping against Grand Anse's soft sands that echoes in your ears long after the sun goes down. It's the aroma of nutmeg and vanilla that wafts through Market Square and throughout the islands' spice plantations. It's the warm sensation you feel in your stomach and on your tongue after sampling the River Antoine Distillery's 150-proof rum. <place>Grenada</place> isn't just meant to be seen; it's meant to be savored.

Americans have long overlooked Grenada (pronounced gre-NAY-da), opting for showier, resort-laden islands. But Yanks, take a hint from the Brits who have spent many a winter here: Grenada is worth visiting. Sure, this part of the Windward Islands doesn't feature the sprawling all-inclusives or glitzy nightclubs of <place>St. Lucia</place> or <place>Barbados</place>; in fact, you may even be hard-pressed to find a fellow American here. But that's the key to <place>Grenada</place>'s charm.
