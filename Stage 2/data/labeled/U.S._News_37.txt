Why Go to <place>Cabo San Lucas</place>
<place>Cabo San Lucas</place> first beckoned to <place>Hollywood</place>'s elite in the 1970s as a luxurious reprieve from the "dregs" of show business. The town's rather seedy reputation changed as world-class resorts took up residence here, in the neighboring village of <place>San José del Cabo</place>, and along the 18-mile stretch of highway that connects the two (known as "the Corridor"). The construction of an international airport in the 1980s made it easier for travelers from all over to hop a nonstop flight to the "Los Cabos" area.

Forty years later, this destination on the southernmost tip of <place>Baja California</place> is still known for its decadence — just take a look at the sprawling golf courses or deluxe villas. But the elitist pretense has dwindled: Days in the spa are just as coveted as evenings at a beachside watering hole. And there's a good chance that you'll see celebutantes and college freshmen sunning themselves side by side on the same stretch of sand.
