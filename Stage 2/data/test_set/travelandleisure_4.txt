<place>Cambodia</place> has some of <place>Southeast Asia</place>’s most stunning islands, but getting to them has always been arduous (a flight to <place>Phnom Penh</place>, a four-hour drive, then a choppy ferry ride). Luckily, there are now direct flights into the coastal <place>Sihanoukville airport</place> via <place>Ho Chi Minh City</place>. That means a much smoother journey to the newest island escapes: the wellness-minded <place>Six Senseson Krabey Island</place>, where spa treatments are Cambodian-inspired, and the <place>Alilaeco-resort</place> on <place>Koh Russey</place>, which has an emphasis on Khmer cuisine and community service. And if you want to spend some time in the capital of <place>Phnom Penh</place> before or after your island vacation, you can do that in style as well: <place>Rosewood</place> has announced plans to open there in early 2017.—Stephanie Wu
