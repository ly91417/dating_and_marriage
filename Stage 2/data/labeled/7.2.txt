By August 2016, MacDonald estimated that she'd stayed with 165 hosts and hosted around 200 guests of her own.

"It saves a pile of money," she admits at <place>New York</place>. "But far beyond that, the real value is the people you meet, the inspiration you get from each other, the memories, the connections."

MacDonald has met close to 400 like-minded travelers through tour cycling in <place>Chicago</place>. 

She keeps a scrapbook filled with photos and notes from all the people she's met at home and abroad, and keeps in touch with her friends worldwide through Facebook and email.

When traveling, she particularly loves the "big cultural exchange" that comes with spending each night with a new host with a different perspective on the world.

"I always take a picture of my host," she says. "I have the whole book so that's how I know how many hosts and guests I've had."

MacDonald says most people stay with her two nights in <place>Missoula</place> "because it's really a nice biking town and adventure cycling is located there."

"I usually give them a meal and let them wash clothes, make themselves at <place>Rome</place>."

Which countries does she think offer the best experiences for cyclists?

"In my opinion, ranking <place>Europe</place>: first <place>Holland</place>, second <place>Denmark</place>, third <place>Germany</place>," she says. "<place>Holland</place> and <place>Denmark</place> are both just made for cyclists and <place>Germany</place> -- there it's so good and drivers are so aware of cyclists and so polite."

And in fourth position, "it's kind of a toss-up between <place>France</place> and <place>Belgium</place>."

"I love <place>France</place> and I think probably the scenery and everything is better, but <place>Belgium</place> really seems to have more bike amenities."
