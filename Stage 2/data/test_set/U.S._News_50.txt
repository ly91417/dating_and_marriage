Why Go to <place>U.S. Virgin Islands</place>
The <place>U.S. Virgin Islands</place> are "America's Caribbean Paradise" — the place to see moko jumbies dance at a Carnival parade, hear the lilting patois of a Creole dialect or smell the spices in a saltfish pate (all without losing cell phone reception). You can visit either <place>St. Thomas</place>, <place>St. John</place> or <place>St. Croix</place>, or better yet, spend a little time on all three islands. That way you'll get plenty of pampering, undisturbed nature and colonial history jammed into one vacation. And bonus: you can pay for everything with U.S. dollars. 

Each island offers something different. Called "Rock City" for its hilly, craggy horizon, <place>St. Thomas</place> is known for luxury — from the mega-yachts moored in the harbor to the high-end storefronts along Main Street. Located a short ferry-ride east, <place>St. John</place> appeals to honeymooners and nature lovers, with more than 7,000 acres of dedicated parkland plus surrounding pristine beaches. Way down south in the <place>Caribbean Sea</place>, less-visited <place>St. Croix</place> has sugar cane plantations and rum distilleries that offer a glimpse into both the past and the present of the <place>Virgin Islands</place>.
