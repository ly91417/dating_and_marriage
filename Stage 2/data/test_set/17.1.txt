The best known national parks


The park service agency oversees 417 sites on 84 million acres around the country, including the headliner national parks, battlefields, civil rights sites, lakeshores and seashores, and even the <place>White House</place>.

The best known sites may be the 59 national parks.

<place>Great Smoky Mountains National Park</place> had 10.7 million visits in 2015, making it the most popular of the 59 headliner national parks. <place>Grand Canyon National Park</place> came in second place (5.5 million), followed by <place>Rocky Mountain National Park</place> (4.16 million), <place>Yosemite National Park</place> (4.10 million) and <place>Yellowstone National Park</place> (4.1 million) rounding out the top five parks.

Many of the 417 park sites depend on 8,000 seasonal employees, many of whom are teachers, college students and people trying to become permanent employees, to supplement the work of about 12,000 permanent and temporary employees and some 400,000 volunteers, according to 2015 data. (The park service hires another 2,000 seasonal workers during other parts of the year.)

Many seasonals come back year after year, creating a community in the parks where they work.

Jennifer Ladino, who worked at <place>Grand Teton National Park</place> for 13 summers from 1996 to 2008, did many different jobs during her time at the park.

Ladino, now an English professor at the <place>University of Idaho</place>, worked at the entrance desk, the public affairs office, handed out backcountry permits and shared safety information during her summers at <place>Grand Teton</place>.

"Seasonals staff the entrance stations and the visitor centers, perform difficult labor related to infrastructure and trail maintenance, manage fires, conduct search and rescue operations, and much more," said Ladino, whose next book will be about about national memorials in the <place>US West</place>.
