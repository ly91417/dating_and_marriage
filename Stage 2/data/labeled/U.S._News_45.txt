Why Go to <place>Seychelles</place>
When the going gets tough, the tough get going — and the rest of us conjure our ideal escape, dreaming of a remote island with crowd-free sands, bright blue waters and a tranquil aura. But when you're ready to turn that dream into a reality, set your sights on <place>Seychelles</place>, a cluster of 115 islands peppering the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of <place>Africa</place> . You may have caught sight of the scenery here before: The seemingly endless white beaches, giant boulders and swaying palms are the stuff of postcards, television commercials and desktop backgrounds. And while you're lounging along these famous shorelines, it's likely that the only other life forms you'll encounter will be the islands' colorful birds and humongous tortoises.

The <place>Seychelles islands</place> are often referred to in two separate groups. Most travelers limit their exploration to the 43 Inner Islands, basing themselves on one of the group's three main isles. <place>Mahé</place> is the largest, home to the <place>Seychellois capital</place>, Victoria, as well as the famed <place>Anse Intendance beach</place> . <place>Praslin</place>, the second largest of the primary islands, also boasts several acclaimed shorelines, not to mention the <place>Vallée de Mai Nature Reserve</place> . And then there's <place>La Digue</place>, a quiet island where bicycles reign supreme and the sands of <place>Anse Source d'Argent</place> beach remain unspoiled. Charter a private yacht further out to sea and you'll likely stumble across one of the 72 Outer Islands, low-lying, sandy cays ruled by wildlife. It doesn't get more remote than that.
