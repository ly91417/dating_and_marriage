<place>Madagascar</place> is sometimes overlooked asjust another safari destination. But this massive island is home to thousands of species that are found nowhere else on earth—more than 90 percent of Madagascar’s flora and fauna are endemic—and with the threat of climate change and deforestation looming ever larger, this is one trip that shouldn’t be delayed. Reinstated Airlink flights from <place>Johannesburg</place> to <place>Nosy</place> Be have expanded access to the northern stretches of the country just in time for the April 2017 opening of <place>Miavana</place>, <place>Madagascar’s</place> most well-appointed property yet. Situated on the <place>island of Nosy Anko</place>, the eco-friendly resort includes 14 villas designed by Silvio Rech and Lesley Carstens, the architects behind similarly luxe <place>African</place> retreats like <place>Chinzombo</place> and <place>Angama Mara</place>. Between seaside pursuits, guests are whisked by helicopter to <place>Ankarana National Park</place> for lemur-spotting or Amber Mountain National Park to explore its waterfalls and crater lakes. —Jane Broughton
