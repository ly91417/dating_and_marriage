After years in <place>Amsterdam</place>’s shadow, the second-largest city in the <place>Netherlands</place> is stepping into the spotlight thanks to its burgeoning culinary and design scenes. Eye-popping architectural stunners such as the <place>Modernist De Rotterdamhave</place> been joined by <place>De Markthal</place>, a mural-covered hall where 96 vendors hawk gourmet goods. You’ll find more locavore eats at <place>Fenix Food Factory</place> and <place>Roffa Streetfoodbar</place>, a smokehouse where virtually everything is locally sourced. Art is everywhere in this city—more than a thousand pieces, including sculptures by Picasso and Rodin, are scattered throughout <place>Rotterdam</place>. Be on the lookout for one of the newest pieces, <place>Bobbing Forest</place>, a surrealist installation of floating elm trees by art collective Mothership. The innovative, fun-loving spirit of the city is best embodied by its upcoming attraction, <place>RiF010</place>, an artificial wave park where surfers will be able to show off their skills in the <place>Steigersgracht Canal</place>.—Diana Hubbell
