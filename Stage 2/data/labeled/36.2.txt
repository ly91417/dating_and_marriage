Bourdain parties like a rock star in <place>Nashville</place>.
"You know, it's the <place>Mother Church</place>. It's the best. You walk in there and you get chill bumps and you say to yourself, 'man, if these walls could talk,'" Wilson said.

An 1892 tabernacle-turned-performance space, the <place>Ryman Auditorium</place> was home to the <place>Grand Ole Opry</place> radio show for three decades and has hosted nearly every name in country music and scores and scores of musicians of other genres.

This "<place>Mother Church</place> of Country Music" is just steps from <place>Lower Broadway</place> and popular downtown <place>Nashville</place> honky-tonk Robert's <place>Western World</place>.
"If we're down at the <place>Ryman</place> for a show, we're going to spend a little time at Robert's and hear some good music," Wilson said.

Wilson's also a fan of a hip-hop party called the Boom Bap, hosted monthly at the <place>Basement East</place> in East <place>Nashville</place>.
Bourdain on <place>Nashville</place>: We left 'damaged but happy'
For a special occasion: <place>Bastion</place>


This scallop and melon dish was a recent offering at <place>Bastion</place>, a new restaurant from chef Josh Habiger.

Wilson and his wife recently had a phenomenal meal at <place>Bastion</place>, a new 24-seat restaurant-within-a-bar from chef Josh Habiger, who brought a flood of national attention to <place>Nashville</place> when he opened The <place>Catbird Seat</place> in 2011.
<place>Bastion</place> is "one of those places where the kitchen does most of the service so you have a lot of interaction with them as far as what you're eating," Wilson said. "You know, all the menu descriptions are like two words. So it's a total guess or you're going to have a conversation."

Case in point from a September menu: the deceptively simple Scallop + Melon.

The dish consists of thin slices of raw scallop placed on pieces of melon, topped with diced white onions soaked in verjus, and sprinkled with tiny basil buds and carrot greens. The plate is then dressed with spicy, Carolina Reaper chile-infused buttermilk and a little bit of tarragon oil.

Another great date night idea? <place>Margot Caf√©</place> in East <place>Nashville</place>, where Wilson sharpened his skills with mentoring from chef Margot McCormack, another <place>Nashville</place> culinary pioneer.
"If you're going out on a date, I just feel like there are few places better than that," Wilson said.

For a casual meal out: <place>Martin's Bar-B-QueJoint</place>.
