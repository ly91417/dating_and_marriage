On Aug. 21,the continental <place>United States</place> will experience atotal solar eclipse for the first time in 38 years. The eclipse will cut a diagonal swath across <place>America</place>, but city lights and overcast skies can be obstacles to prime viewing. A good bet is <place>Grand Teton</place> in <place>Wyoming</place>, which will get a generous two minutes and 20 seconds of darkness. If you miss the eclipse, you’ll still be surrounded by the jagged peaks, mountain lakes and wildlife of a pristine national park in its summer glory.— Elisabeth Eaves
