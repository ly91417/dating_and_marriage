The region of <place>Andalusia</place> in southern <place>Spain</place> has a new — but very old — archaeological gem to celebrate: A site in the town of <place>Antequera</place> that is home to ancient dolmens, megalithic tombs built from massive stones believed to be over 5,000 years old. In July, three of these well-preserved monuments, along with two nearby mountains, received Unesco World Heritage status, and the area is now primed for exploration.— Ingrid K. Williams
