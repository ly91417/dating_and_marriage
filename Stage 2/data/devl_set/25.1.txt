He and his friends gravitated toward food on the other end of the spectrum from what they made at work, and <place>Sichuan</place> food presented a fresh challenge for Bowien.

As a chef, he could frequently decode how things were made.

"But when I would go eat <place>Sichuan</place> food, it was the first time in a long time that I'd gone somewhere and been like.

He started cooking <place>Sichuan</place> cuisine at a <place>San Francisco</place> pop-up eatery inside a Chinese restaurant, and <place>Mission Chinese Food</place> was born.

In 2013, he won a James Beard Award for Rising Star Chef of the Year.

Now, at 33, Bowien has three restaurants: <place>Mission Chinese Food</place> restaurants in <place>New York</place> and <place>San Francisco</place> and <place>New York</place>'s <place>Mission Cantina</place>, which serves both Mexican and Chinese food.

He's bounced back from a humbling closure of Mission Chinese in <place>New York</place> for health violations shortly after it opened.

He plays in a band, as the drummer for Narx. And he's a husband and father who finds time to SoulCycle.

Bowien appears surprised by his trajectory.

Before he headed to culinary school, largely for the opportunity to live in <place>San Francisco</place>, he worked in an optometrist's office and played music.

But Bowien used to tell his mom, who died when he was a teenager, that he'd open a restaurant.

"You're like, 'Oh, one day I'll do this or one day I'll do that. I'm going to be an astronaut,' " he said.

"I'm sure there's a few astronauts out there that said that when they were younger and they're there now like, 'Yeah, I didn't really think this was going to happen, but it did.' "
