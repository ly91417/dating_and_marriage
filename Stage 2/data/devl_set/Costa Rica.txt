Why: <place>Costa Rica</place> is the one of the most biodiverse places on the planet and to be able to see this on a shoestring is an incredible opportunity. There's a ton of national parks to explore, for instance, that only cost a few dollars to enter. Once there, you can then enjoy free self-guided walks that won't cost you a cent, but will deliver some great encounters with amazing wildlife like tapirs, monkeys, sloths and macaws. <place>Manuel Antonio</place> and <place>Corcovado National Parks</place> are two of the best. Public transport is also super cheap in <place>Costa Rica</place>, with buses generally less than $10, even for an eight-hour ride. This makes traveling between destinations in this compact country very affordable and means you can see a lot in a short amount of time. In addition, budget accommodation in Costa Rica — even at some of the best surf beaches — can be as little as $6 per person. And a "plato tipico" (local dish) can be enjoyed anywhere for as little as $2-3.
