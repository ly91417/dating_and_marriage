The nation that hates to be late

Although many countries are saddled with stereotypes, in <place>Switzerland</place>’s case they’re dead on.

The alpine nation really is highly efficient. And meticulously punctual. Clean, too. For chronically tardy, resolutely inefficient (not to mention slovenly) people like myself, a visit to <place>Switzerland</place> yields a cocktail of emotions: awe, relief and a dash of irritation.

For the Swiss, punctuality is not merely a nicety, a bonbon in the buffet of life. It is a source of deep contentment. The Swiss, it seems, subscribe to the German philosopher Schopenhauer’s definition of happiness as “an absence of misery”. They derive genuine joy from the fact that life unfolds on time and in a highly efficient manner.

<place>Switzerland</place> is known for its timekeeping and cleanliness.

Whenever I visit <place>Switzerland</place>, I go through several stages of punctuality reaction. At first it delights me, especially if I’m coming from neighbouring <place>Italy</place> or <place>France</place> with their rather more flexible approach to timekeeping. By contrast, life in <place>Switzerland</place> is sturdy and dependable, like a Saint Bernard dog. If someone says they will meet me at 2 pm, they arrive at 2 pm not 2:05 (or 1:55, for that matter). I like this. For a while.  

Then it annoys me. The extreme punctuality strikes me as a kind of stinginess, and I find myself agreeing with the English writer Evelyn Waugh who said that “punctuality is the virtue of the bored.”

That is unfair though, and finally, invariably, I come to appreciate Swiss punctuality for what it is: a deep expression of respect for other people. A punctual person is a considerate one. By showing up on time – for everything – a Swiss person is saying, in effect, “I value your time and, by extension, I value you.”

Punctuality is alive and well in <place>Switzerland</place>.

It’s no coincidence that the Swiss are the world’s watchmakers. Which came first – the precise timekeepers or the precise people? Hard to say, but the result is the same: a nation where the trains – and everything else – really do run on time. Then there are the toilets.

“Have you seen our public toilets?” asked Dieter, a Swiss doctor, over an afternoon beer in <place>Geneva</place>. “They are very clean.” He’s right. Swiss toilets are indeed clean, as is everything else too. In some countries it would be suicidal to drink the tap water. In <place>Switzerland</place> it is fashionable to do so; the water comes from natural springs.
