Where: <place>Mazatlan</place>, <place>Mexico</place>
Chosen By: Holly Johnson, founder of Club Thrifty, a website with tips on travel savings whose motto is “Stop spending. Start living”
Why: The current exchange rate ($1 = 20.69 Mexican pesos) makes Mexico one of the most affordable destinations. For the frugal traveler who wants to enjoy more culture than they might in the <place>Riviera Maya</place>, my top pick is <place>Mazatlan</place> . As the shrimp capital of <place>Mexico</place> and a foodie paradise, <place>Mazatlan</place> is teeming with awesome eateries and fresh, interesting dishes. Hotels (including all-inclusive properties) are extremely inexpensive and authentic since most aren't part of the huge chains. <place>El Cid Marina</place> has awesome pools that are perfect for families, great food and huge rooms. (Rates are as low as $100 for a family of four.) You can also enjoy superb dining at a top-notch restaurant like Casa 46 for less than half what you'd pay in the <place>United States</place>. Side note: <place>Sinaloa</place> (the state where Mazatlan resides) grows the bulk of produce in <place>Mexico</place>, so Mazatlan produce is unbelievably cheap as a result. You see this reflected in top restaurants all the way down to street markets.
