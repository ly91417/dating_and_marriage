Why Go to <place>New Orleans</place>
<place>New Orleans</place> is known for its European-style architecture, mouth-watering Creole cuisine and all-around mysticism. And as its backbone is music: Jazz, blues, rock 'n' roll and Zydeco tunes ooze from every city crevice. But for many, the main reason to visit is Mardi Gras, an over-the-top party with Carnaval traits, such as masks, music and an all-around wild time. Even if you don't make it to Mardi Gras, you'll still find a party year-round, with revelers pouring out of Bourbon Street clubs until the wee hours of the morning.
Despite past environmental disasters — namely the BP Oil Spill, Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Isaac — <place>New Orleans</place> continues to thrive. Over the past several years, major efforts have been made to restore the distinct districts. Today, the <place>Crescent City<place> looks almost as good as new. So start your visit in the French Quarter, where colonial heritage still survives. From here, you can explore the major architectural sites before enjoying a hearty plate of jambalaya and a rowdy evening out.
