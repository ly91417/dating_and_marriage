Why Go to <place>Athens</place>
Few cities rival Athens when it comes to historical importance. As the sun rises over the smooth marble monuments of the <place>Acropolis</place> and fills the cobblestone streets along its base, the people of Athens emerge from their homes and head to local markets or sidewalk games of chess. Life moves more slowly, as if the entire city is reveling in blissful retirement from its glory days as a political and cultural powerhouse. But as the sun sets, <place>Athens</place>' contradictions come to light: The air thickens with the aroma of spiced lamb and music from a nearby taverna, dance clubs blast rock music amidst ancient columns, and the bright lights of Omonia Square mirror the glistening columns of the Parthenon, illuminated for all to see.

Most attractions are located within the city center, which is dominated by the <place>Acropolis</place> where renowned ruins like the <place>Parthenon</place> and the <place>Theatre of Dionysus</place> are located. <place>Athens</place>' historic districts are located along the lower slopes of the <place>Acropolis</place>, and you'll find the more modernized sections of the city as you travel east. Head west and you'll eventually reach the suburbs, vacation homes, luxury resorts and beaches along the <place>Mediterranean Sea's Saronic Gulf</place> . From there you can follow the Athenian recipe for beating the heat and take to the sea; take a ferry from Piraeus to nearby islands, such as <place>Aegina Island</place>, for shopping or unforgettable seafood.s
