This city on the western coast of Honshu has seen a boost in visits since a bullet-train extension shortened the trip from <place>Tokyo</place> to just 2½ hours. Go for the old wooden teahouses of the <place>Higashi Chayagai</place> district, the beautiful samurai residence in <place>Nagamachi</place>, and the contemporary art museum. Then have your pick of sushi that’s just as good as, and much cheaper than, what you’d find in <place>Tokyo</place>. Try it at <place>Sentori</place>, <place>Kagayasuke</place>, or <place>Omi-cho</place> Market—a favorite of sushi master Masa. For a truly traditional experience, head to <place>the Noto Peninsula</place> and stay in a Japanese farmhouse, where you can forage for wild mountain greens and mushrooms and dine by an indoor fire pit.—Selena Hoy
