Post-Iron Curtain <place>Budapesthas</place> emerged as an animated metropolis. An appealing, youthful energy increasingly arises in the city, at new restaurants like <place>Szimply</place> and <place>Margá Bisztro</place>. Visitors can peruse Hungarian-made jewelry and quirky housewares at <place>Velvet Chemistry</place> and <place>Szimpla Design Shop</place>. A slate of new accommodations, including the locally designed <place>Hotel Rum</place>, further signals the city’s stylish ascent.— Alia Akkam
