The <place>Maldives</place> may be sinking because of climate change, but hope springs eternal — the entire archipelago has applied for Unesco biosphere reserve status for 2017, and more than 25 hotels opened in 2016 or will open in 2017. They include the eco-friendly <place>Soneva Jani</place>, whose bedrooms have retractable roofs, and the <place>Four Seasons Voavah Baa Atoll</place>, entirely located within a Unesco biosphere, while the Italian hotel <place>Baglioni</place> opens on the private island of <place>Maagau</place> this summer. Taking an early plunge is <place>Hurawahli</place>, one of the world’s largest subsea restaurants, opening in November. <place>Malé International Airport</place>’s $450 million renovation includes a new runway aimed at increasing travelers.​— Adam H.
