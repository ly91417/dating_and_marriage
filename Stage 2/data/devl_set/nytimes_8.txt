<place>Detroit</place>’s revitalization, after its 2013 bankruptcy filing, has long been building. In 2015, it was named a <place>Unesco City of Design</place>. But 2017 may be the year promise becomes reality. The new QLine streetcar is expected to open in April, connecting the central <place>Woodward Avenue</place> corridor some 3.3 miles between downtown and the revived <place>New Center</place> area. It passes through <place>Midtown</place>, home to the <place>Detroit Institute of Arts</place>, and the entertainment-focused <place>District Detroit</place>, where a stadium opening this fall will be shared by the <place>Detroit</place> Red Wings and, in a return from the suburbs, the Detroit Pistons.— Elaine Glusac
