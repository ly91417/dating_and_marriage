8 new hotels with surprising past lives

To that end, more companies in the <place>United States</place> are involved in adaptive-reuse projects -- rehabbing buildings with a variety of past lives into hotels and other businesses that have a bit more pep and personality than some of the new-construction alternatives.

"You're able to get sort of that patina of a culture through its architecture, its history," said Gray Shealy, executive director of the Master's in Hospitality Management program at <place>Georgetown University's School of Continuing Studies</place>.

In 2006, the first 21c <place>Museum Hotel</place> opened in downtown <place>Louisville</place>, <place>Kentucky</place>, mixing top-tier contemporary art, fine dining and lodging in a series of renovated tobacco and bourbon warehouses.

Preserving farmland is a big driver in choosing 21c locations.

Five of 21c's six open properties are housed in old buildings, from the warehouses in <place>Louisville</place> to a former Ford Model T assembly plant in <place>Oklahoma City</place>.

Here are a handful of recent or upcoming properties that are rehabbed and ready for a new chapter:

21c <place>Museum Hotel</place>, <place>Oklahoma City</place>


Ford Model Ts used to occupy the building that now houses the 21c Museum Hotel in <place>Oklahoma City</place>.
