Why Go to <place>Chicago</place>
"It is hopeless for the occasional visitor to try to keep up with <place>Chicago</place> . She outgrows his prophecies faster than he can make them." Although he made up his mind about the Windy City before it even reached its 50th year, Mark Twain's impression of Chicago has proven long-lasting. America's third-largest city has been described in a myriad of ways throughout its lifetime. When Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla were competing for the right to use their forms of electricity to illuminate the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition (also known as the Chicago World's Fair), <place>Chicago</place> was known as a city of industry. When Prohibition set in, notorious mobsters like Al Capone transformed Chicagoland into their own dangerous playground. And intense immigration surges throughout the 20th century brought a host of new identities to the Windy City, including Greek, Polish, Italian, Irish and Jewish.

Today, <place>Chicago</place> remains just as diverse, boasting a thriving arts scene, various shopping districts and a cornucopia of eateries. First-time Chi-Town visitors are sure to have their eyes to the sky for at least a day or two. <place>Chicago</place>'s skyscrapers and public art are absolutely worth admiring: Tag along on a Chicago Architecture River Cruise or pass a few hours in <place>Millennium Park</place> and you'll find yourself spending lots of time looking upward. For a bird's-eye perspective, head to Willis Tower's Skydeck Chicago or the <place>John Hancock Center</place>'s <place>360 CHICAGO Observation Deck</place> . After, dive headfirst into all the city has to offer â€“ from exceptional museums to a thriving sports culture and deep-dish pizza that takes delicious to whole new depths.
