This wind-hugged sliver of an island in the <place>Dardanelles</place> is delightfully secluded: a 50-minute plane ride from <place>Istanbul</place> to <place>Canakkale</place> followed by a leisurely ferry ride on the <place>Geyikli-Bozcaada</place> feribot(and thus far, untouched by the violence that has shadowed the country). Despite its modest size, <place>Bozcaada</place> is covered in vineyards and home to six vintners, including the widely known <place>Corvus</place>. Beyond the vines are coves, ancient ruins, two beaches and a latte-colored Ottoman castle. Even the cobblestone downtown area has gotten more mellow: it became a traffic-free zone in 2015.â€” Charu Suri
