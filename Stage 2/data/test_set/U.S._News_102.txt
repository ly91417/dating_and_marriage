Why Go to <place>Edinburgh</place>
Burrowed beside long-dormant volcanoes and reigning over green moorlands, <place>Edinburgh</place> (or Ed-n-bruh in Scots speech) is known for more than its staggering landscape. The <place>Athens</place> of the North, as Edinburgh is sometimes nicknamed, also claims a cast of near-mythic characters: Rebel leader Sir William Wallace (aka Braveheart); the tragic Mary, Queen of Scots; the Enlightenment thinkers David Hume and Adam Smith; "James Bond" actor Sean Connery; and prolific wordsmiths Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and JK Rowling â€“ are all woven into this very old yet very relevant city.

But if your impression is confined to bagpipes, tartans, crests and kilts, you'd be wrong. The second most-visited city in <place>the United Kingdom</place> (after <place>London</place>), <place>Edinburgh</place> offers an abundance of things to do. History buffs will enjoy Edinburgh Castle, Holyroodhouse Palace and other attractions found along the Royal Mile. Those in search of an authentic live-as-the-locals experience will find it in the outer-lying neighborhood pubs, shops and parks. Shoppers will find retail bliss in <place>New Town</place>; art aficionados will enjoy the free National Gallery of <place>Scotland</place>; and theater hounds will meet their match at August's <place>Edinburgh</place> Festival.
