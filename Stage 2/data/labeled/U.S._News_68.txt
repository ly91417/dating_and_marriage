Why Go to <place>Buenos Aires</place>
Skirting the border of <place>Argentina</place> and <place>Uruguay</place>, Buenos Aires lures visitors with its blend of European charm and <place>South American flair</place> . Featuring wide boulevards, neoclassical architecture and a cache of avant-garde museums, this sophisticated city has earned its title as "the Paris of South America." But don't think of its resemblance as anything other than a marker of its ancestry. Fashionable and friendly residents – known as porteños – have customized the city, from their colorful art-laden barrios (districts) to their world-class soccer (fútbol) stadium to their street-side tango sessions.

But you can do more than just join artists, dancers, and enthused soccer fans in this cosmopolitan capital. Shop <place>San Telmo</place>'s boutiques, explore the <place>National Museum of Fine Arts</place>, meander through the ornate Recoleta Cemetery, or catch a horse race at the <place>Palermo Hippodrome</place> . Just save time to enjoy the simple pleasure of sipping a cafecito (espresso) and snacking on churros (fried dough strips) at a cozy café, taking a romantic stroll along <place>Palermo Woods' Rose Garden Walk</place> (Paseo del Rosedal), and staying up late to revel in the sultry tango sessions that give the city its evening zest.
