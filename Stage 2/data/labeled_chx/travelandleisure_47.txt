Best known for its historic cafes and the Shroud of <place>Turin</place>, the city is also a vibrant contemporary art destination. Last year, superstar curator Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev was named director of two major institutions, <place>Galleria Civica d'Arte Moderna</place>, <place>Italy</place>'s first modern art museum, and <place>Castello di Rivoli</place>, its first contemporary art museum, featuring works from powerhouses like <place>Michelangelo Pistoletto</place> and <place>Paul McCarthy</place>. Earlier eras can be explored at two other newly overhauled museums: the <place>Galleria Sabauda</place>, where visitors can see more than 500 works once owned by the royal Savoy family, and the <place>Egyptian Museum</place>, which houses one of the most extensive Egyptian-artifact collections in the world. Early in 2017, <place>Turin</place>'s medieval roots will be revealed at Lavazza coffee's new headquarters in the Aurora neighborhood, when the company unveils a fourth-century basilica discovered during construction. â€”Carol Kino
