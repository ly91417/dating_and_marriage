Sitting next to me was Niranjan, who witnessed a tiger kill his father when he was just 11 years old. Next to him, staring unblinking through bloodshot eyes, was Sunil, who watched a tiger drag his wife from their fishing boat and carry her into the forest.

According to Saptarshi Mondal, a <place>Sundarbans</place> forest guide tasked with helping me explore the relationship between the area’s residents and tigers while simultaneously keeping me from the jaws of one, climate change is heightening the issue, depleting the animal’s traditional food source.

Her anguish evident, I asked Kaushalya if she feels animosity towards the creature that took her husband.

“I do not blame the tiger,” she said. “It was our fault. We went in front of the tiger, not the other way around. I still worship Dakshin Rai.”

Dakshin Rai, known colloquially as the tiger god, is a revered deity in the <place>Sundarbans</place>, who, along with the forest guardian, Bon Bibi, is said to protect all of the region’s inhabitants. Before venturing deep into the jungle, honey collectors and fishermen make offerings at one of the deity’s many shrines, hoping to return safely.

Although this reverence towards tigers may be rooted in religious superstition, there is a practical element too.

“The <place>Sundarbans</place> needs its tigers,” Saptarshi said, as we walked briskly back towards the port; light fading, my fear of a fatal tiger attack growing. “Otherwise the forest will not survive.”

Approximately 30 people are killed by tigers in the <place>Sundarbans</place> every year.

The name <place>Sundarbans</place> is said to derive from the endangered sundari tree, a species of mangrove that flourishes within the region. Its hard and fine-grained timber is a desirable material for high-end wood products, including furniture.

“Without tigers [and the government’s enforced protection of their habitat], woodcutters will come and cut down the forest,” he said.

The government’s dedication to preserving the tiger’s homeland also protects the <place>Sundarbans</place> from development, and, increasingly, provides an income through tiger-based tourism.

This is why, despite seeing friends and relatives maimed before their eyes, the people of the <place>Sundarbans</place> do not hate tigers.They know their fate is ultimately tied to the killer cats: the tigers protect the forest and the forest protects the people.

After generations of sharing their home with fearsome man-eaters, you’d be forgiven for believing there is nothing that scares these steely communities. But, unfortunately, you’d be wrong.
