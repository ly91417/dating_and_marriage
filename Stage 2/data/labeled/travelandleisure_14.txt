Thetotal solar eclipseon August 21 will be the first in almost 40 years to be visible from the continental U.S., with a path of totality that slashes across the States from <place>Oregon</place> to <place>South Carolina</place>. For prime viewing, head to <place>Jackson</place> Hole—spectacular scenery, expansive vistas, and minimal light pollution make it an ideal vantage point. Once the two-minute main event is over, there are plenty of warm-weather activities to keep you occupied, from hiking the backcountry of Grand Teton andYellowstonenational parks to exploring <place>Jackson</place> proper (be sure to snag a pastry at Persephone Bakery and a chic, locally crafted souvenir at Made). —Lila Battis
