Why Go to <place>Tuscany</place>
When the film adaptation of Frances Mayes' "Under the Tuscan Sun" came out in 2003, the idea that <place>Tuscany</place> was indeed a place of romance, chianti wine, olives, aromatic cooking and, of course, sunshine was deeply embedded in our brains. Today, many travelers visit this glorious region in northwest Italy to escape the hustle and bustle of Rome or Milan and instead take in the Italian countryside. The combination of castles-turned-wineries-turned-hotels, elegant cypress trees, cascading hills and sprawling vineyards is simply heavenly.

Time seems to slow in this effortlessly idyllic place. And what better way to unwind than by savoring a glass of vino or eating homemade gnocchi under the <place>Tuscan</place> sun?
