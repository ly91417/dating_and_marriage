<place>Iguazu Falls</place>, <place>Argentine-Brazilian</place> border


On the border between <place>Argentina</place> and <place>Brazil</place>, <place>Iguazu Falls</place> are actually a system of 275 drops that create tiers of waterfalls in a horseshoe shape that's dotted by islands, draped in mist, and linked by rainbows.

Like a scene from "Avatar," or an actual scene from "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull," the falls are nature at its most dramatic and humbling.

Osho was a 1970s mystic who became known as the "sex guru" (though only for straight people) whose followers gained notoriety over a bioterror attack and murder plots in Oregon.

That might not sound like the best introduction to a sexually recharging getaway, but the meditation resort in <place>Pune</place> has been running since 1974, with (pricey) wardrobes, activities and meditations where thousands of people still go to find a certain kind of awakening.

<place>Uluru</place> (<place>Ayers Rock</place>), <place>Australia</place>


The massive sandstone rock formation in central <place>Australia</place> is one of those places that puts life into perspective.

It's sacred to the indigenous people in <place>Australia</place>, even as it's become one of the country's most recognizable destinations.

Author Joanne Fedler, whose recent books have focused on improving family and romantic relationships, says <place>Uluru</place> is "a place to quietly contemplate your insignificance."
She says it's "a place that exudes peace and ancient tranquility, spoiled only by the tourists who ignore the requests not to climb on it due to its sacred significance to the Aboriginal people.

"Be sure to catch it at sunrise where the rock turns a luminescent orange -- for a short while."
