Rice aroma: Originating in southern <place>Guangxi</place> province, this is probably the lightest among the four types. Unlike other baijiu styles, it's made from rice, which gives it a sweet, floral tone. A fine example of this type of baijiu is Guilin Sanhua, made using water sourced from the picturesque local <place>Li River</place>.

Light aroma: This style dominates the north, especially around <place>Beijing</place>. Fermented solely from sorghum, the light aroma isn't matched by ABVs as high as 56%. The brand Erguotou, with its iconic square-shaped bottled, falls into this category. In terms of the taste, light aroma baijius are usually delicate and dry.

Strong aroma: <place>China</place>'s most popular baijiu is produced with at least two different grains and fermented in mud pits, giving it a more complex and almost overripe flavor. A fine example is Luzhou Laojiao, a distillery that brews the spirit of the same name and is one of the oldest still in production (from 1573).

Sauce aroma: Some say this almost savory drink's flavor resembles soy sauce. The most popular brand, Moutai, produced using labor-intensive methods in Guizhou province, is the most expensive type of baijiu. A batch of Moutai has to go through rounds of subterranean fermentation so it usually takes a year to produce.

Jim Boyce, a Canadian wine expert based in <place>Beijing</place>, is the founder of World Baijiu Day, aimed at promoting the best-selling yet little-known spirit.
He said 30 Baijiu Day events were held in 20 cities around the world last year.

Dedicated baijiu bars are now found in <place>Liverpool</place> and <place>New York</place>.

There are also a growing number of overseas baijiu brands. ByeJoe in the <place>United States</place>, Taizi in <place>New Zealand</place> and Dragon's Mist in <place>Canada</place> are milder versions of <place>China</place>'s most eye-watering drink.

In <place>China</place>, people are experimenting with baijiu too.

Seminars are being held on how to pair it with food and some entrepreneurs have developed baijiu-infused ice cream, pizza and gummy bears. A chef in <place>Beijing</place> even created deep-fried baijiu cake.
The government is also promoting baijiu tourism, a Chinese version of a Bordeaux tour in <place>Maotai</place>, <place>Guizhou province</place>.
Boyce suggests first timers "compare and contrast" different baijiu styles side by side.

"Just as with a flight of wine or whiskey or tequila, a flight of baijiu is bound to make you think more deeply about smells, tastes and, ultimately, preferences," he says.

"Lots of people assume all baijiu is pretty much the same. Trying different styles side-by-side reveals a great deal of diversity."
