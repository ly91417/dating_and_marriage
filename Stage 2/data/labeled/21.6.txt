People tend to get picky about their barbeque, but the <place>Moonlite</place> has carved out a niche that everyone respects.
What started as a small roadside restaurant has grown into a landmark, famed for its hickory-smoked mutton.

People who remember the 30-seat place that <place>Moonlite</place> started as may not recognize the 350-seat destination that it's become, but it's still a family business cooking meat the way they've always done, in a way that tastes like home.


In early April, cherry blossoms bloom along <place>Kyoto</place>'s <place>Okazaki Canal</place>.

The city is famous for its blossoms, but along the canal a footpath passes under the trees right alongside the water, which reflects the flowers back up.

The stroll is like walking through a pink floral tunnel, but only for a short time each year. This is a happiness that has to be seized when the moment is just right.
