The duck breast on his current dinner menu, offered with sweet potato, savoy cabbage, farro spaetzle and maple gastrique, is cooked with ginger and a little cardamom.

"It's subtle but it works and it tastes great," he says.

That creativity can also be seen at Spice to Table, a low-key Indian lunch restaurant launched by chef Asha Gomez, who was born and raised in <place>Southern India</place> and moved to <place>Atlanta</place> after she married more than 20 years ago. (She also credits Quatrano for inspiration.)

Her fried chicken has been dubbed some of the best in country, with its 24-hour brine with secret spices, coconut oil, mango sauce and roasted curry leaves. (It's only available Friday and Saturdays for lunch, until they run out.)

So has her spiced carrot cake, which people drive hundreds of miles to eat. Her version uses fresh carrots, clove, cardamom and black peppercorns, and it's also in her new cook book, "My Two Souths."

The <place>General Muir</place> near <place>Emory University</place>, which takes a <place>New York</place> Jewish deli upscale, is one of food writer Susan Puckett's favorite restaurants with a sense of place.

There's high-end seasonal cuisine, but the all-important reuben sandwich, pastrami sandwich, bagels and lox and more are generally available. So are menus for the Jewish High Holidays.

"Restaurants opening now are more connected to the community, have more of a distinct personality and are more a reflection of chefs and owners as well as their surroundings," Puckett says. "Whenever I go there, I feel this sense of community."

Many chefs, restaurant workers and food lovers still head to Buford Highway and the outer <place>Atlanta</place> suburbs, where many Asian, Latin American and other mom and pop dining spots serve authentic ethnic cuisine.

Don't want to choose? There's a way to do that at the restaurants at <place>Krog Street Market</place> or <place>Ponce City Market</place>'s food hall in midtown <place>Atlanta</place>, which is a who's who of the city's top chefs.

A bowl of Japanese ramen at <place>Guy Wong's Ton Ton</place> can be followed by a Cuban sandwich at <place>Hector Santiago's El Super Pan</place>, followed by fresh pasta at <place>Bellina Alimentari</place> and Indian street food at <place>Botiwalla</place>.

Quatrano fans can stop by her <place>W.H. Stiles Fish Camp</place>, while <place>Restaurant Eugene's Linton Hopkins</place> has his lovely take on burgers and chicken at H&F Burger and Hop's Chicken.

Finish it all off with an espresso shot at <place>Acheson's Spiller Park Coffee</place>, and that's a food tour of <place>Atlanta</place>.
