With its first airport opening this year and its first rail link in the works, the remote northeastern Indian state of <place>Sikkim</place> keeps getting closer. Adventurous souls can trek <place>Khangchendzonga National Park</place>, a Himalayan haven of forests, valleys and mountains — including the world’s third-highest peak — that earned Unesco World Heritage status this year. Spiritual seekers, meanwhile, can pursue nirvana around the historically Buddhist land, from centuries-old Buddhist monasteries like <place>Tashiding</place> and <place>Pemayangtse</place> to the museum-like <place>Namgyal Institute of Tibetology</place>. And load up on spices, fruits and vegetables. <place>Sikkim</place> became the first fully organic state in <place>India</place> last year.— Seth Sherwood
