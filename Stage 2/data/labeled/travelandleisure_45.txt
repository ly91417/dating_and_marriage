A mélange of cultural and geographic influences has given this string of seaside towns on <place>Morocco</place>’s <place>Mediterranean coast</place> a uniquely European flavor, and recent upscale openings have turned the area into a bona fide resort destination. Last spring in the town of <place>Mdiq</place>, <place>Sofitel debutedTamuda Bay Beach</place>; Spa, a 104-room hotel with a palette inspired by the mid-20th-century Côte d’Azur. It’s a lively contrast to the subdued Moorish aesthetic of <place>Banyan Tree Tamouda Bay</place>, a new all-villa resort 20 minutes north in <place>Fnidek</place>. But there’s more to the region than sun and surf: the nearby port city of <place>Tétouan</place> has several museums and one of <place>Morocco</place>’s best-preserved medinas. Head there now—with a <place>Ritz-Carlton Reserve</place> on the horizon, <place>Tamuda Bay</place> won’t stay under the radar for long.—Lila Battis
