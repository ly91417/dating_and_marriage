It’s now possible to spot the Big Five in <place>Botswana</place>, an idea that just a few years ago may have seemed far-fetched. Buoyed by the antipoaching efforts of the <place>Botswana</place> government and local conservation groups, the philanthropic arm of the (impeccably renovated)Sanctuary Chief’s Camphas helped reintroduce populations of both black and white rhinos to the <place>Okavango Delta</place>. The neighboring and Beyond Nxabega Okavango Tented Campalso got a thoughtful redesign of late, with understated, sustainable accommodations that echo the surrounding landscape. For lovers of wildlife and luxury, there’s never been a better time to visit. —Krista Simmons
