Gabon, a politically stable African country with abundant wildlife, isn’t on many must-see lists, largely because of its lack of infrastructure. It’s still challenging to move within the country and hotels are rare, but the government is working to change that. In the last five years, it has improved the country’s international airport, introduced an online visa application, established a national park system in long-protected reserves and neared completion of a national coastal road. Last year, two lodges reopened, notably <place>Loango Lodge</place>, situated at the main entry point to <place>Loango National Park</place> and the gorilla habituation project. And in 2017, two more lodges will open near the <place>Langoué Bai</place> and <place>Lopé national parks</place>.— Kelly DiNardo
