Once prohibitively expensive,the city’sstill not cheap—but the dollar's worth around 25 percent more today than it was two years ago. Some 28 million additional visitors will pass through <place>Oslo</place>’s airport in the next 12 months, thanks to its new swooping, Scandi-chic wing. Many of these travelers are here to participate in one of the world’s most thriving coffee cultures. Two great spots are in the <place>Grünerløkka</place> area <place>Supreme Roastworks</place>, where a world-champion brewer helms the bar, and Tim Wendelboe, whose owner is so obsessed with quality beans that he bought 17 acres of Colombian farmland. After the buzz from your first few pour-overs wears off, explore another formerly gritty neighborhood, the warehouse-filled <place>Vulkan</place>, where Hendrix Ibsen sells the trendy triumvirate of single-origin coffee, vinyl, and craft beer.—Eimear Lynch
