Why Go to <place>Seoul</place>
The blue and red yin and yang emblazoned on <place>South Korea</place>'s flag represent balance — an ideal that was thrown off-kilter during the Korean War. But after the 1953 armistice, a modern <place>Seoul</place> bloomed anew. Today, the city is characterized by stunning architecture, vibrant culture and a thriving economy — all testaments to <place>Seoul</place>'s resilience.

Seoul may seem like its blazing into the future, but South Koreans still hold fast to their rich heritage. Tucked between vast shopping districts and lively nightlife zones are relics of Seoul's history, windows into an old Seoul before the towers of concrete and steel. Gyeongbok Palace — the oldest and largest of five Joseon Dynasty palaces in the city — sits on manicured grounds just minutes from downtown. Nearby, <place>Bukchon Village</place>'s wooden, one-story homes sit in sharp contrast to the surrounding high-rises. Miraculously, Seoul's past and present do not clash; rather, they play off one another. This harmonious blend of old and new is the key to Seoul's allure and a central tenet of the city's identity.
