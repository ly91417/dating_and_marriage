Bed down at the boutique <place>Hulbert House</place>, with six suites in an 1888 <place>Victorian villa</place>, or the 69-room <place>QT Queenstown</place>, which is slated to land on the shores of <place>Lake Wakatipu</place> this year. And those who have previously traveled here for adrenaline rushes have a new treat in store: the <place>Nevis Thriller</place>, coming early in 2017. Details are sparse, but its creator, the <place>AJ Hackett</place> company, says it will combine “speed, height, and flight.”—Carrie Hutchinson
