In January, the Canadian city kicks off a year of events in honor of its375th birthday. Look for art pop-ups, symphony performances, and the unveiling of the <place>Promenade Fleuve-Montagne</place>, an urban boardwalk that will connect <place>Mont-Royal</place> to the <place>St. Lawrence River</place>. And plan on returning a few pounds heavier. Montreal’s phenomenal culinary scene—influenced by its French-British background and multiethnic population—is drawing interest from foodies far beyond Canada’s borders. Don’t misslocal favorites like Foxy and Candide, which prove that sophisticated doesn’t have to mean stiff, and the hotly anticipated Marconi, from chef Mehdi Brunet-Benkritly, who recently moved back to his native Montreal after a five-year stint in New York City. —Mary Holland
