Why Go to <place>Cancun</place>
<place>Cancún</place> is nothing if not resilient. Consider the debilitating effects <place>Hurricane Wilma</place> had on the region in 2005 — drowned shores, destroyed storefronts and capsized boats. But now, this skinny "7"-shaped barrier island in southeastern Mexico is once again a go-to spot for beaches, golfing and nightlife. <place>Cancún</place> also remains one of the most affordable vacation destinations in the <place>Western Hemisphere</place> — you could pay less than $600 per person for an all-inclusive vacation along these <place>Yucatán</place> sands, even during the self-indulgent spring break season.

So what's there to do here? <place>Cancún</place>'s beaches are spectacular spots to try some jet skiing and parasailing. And there's also a host of after-hours activities; be sure to check out the acrobatic dance performances at the <place>Coco Bongo Cancún</place> . This area is also close to one of the most recognizable sites of <place>Mexico</place> — don't miss out on the chance to behold Chichén Itzá, a large Mayan archaeological site that is one of the new Seven Wonders of the World.
