In recent years,the former fishing community of <place>Puerto Escondido</place>, with its palapa-lined beaches and long-established surf scene, has seen the opening of the stylish <place>Hotel Escondido</place>; a number of imaginative haute Mexican restaurants, including <place>Almoraduz</place>; and a new arts complex, <place>Casa Wabi</place>, founded by one of <place>Mexico</place>’s most famous living artists, Bosco Sodi. With <place>Oaxaca</place> state’s capital, <place>Oaxaca City</place>, grappling again with political violence once early last year, coastal <place>Puerto Escondido</place> has emerged as a beachy, bohemian alternative.— Freda Moon
