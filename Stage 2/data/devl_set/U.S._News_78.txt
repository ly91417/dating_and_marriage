Why Go to <place>Quebec City</place>
The sight of winding cobblestone streets and towering cathedrals; the sound of French pleasantries and tourists' "Oohs;" the smell of fresh-baked bread and pungent cheese; the taste of creamy cafe lattes and buttery croissants. All your senses agree: You're in France. But they're wrong: You're in <place>Québec</place> .

<place>Québec City</place> – the capital of the Canadian province, <place>Québec</place> – dwelled in the shadow of its neighbor, <place>Montreal</place>, for a long time, but the 2008 celebration of its 400th birthday catapulted <place>Québec City</place> back into the spotlight. Since then, travelers have flocked here to experience this UNESCO World Heritage site's charm for themselves. As the birthplace of <place>New France</place>, <place>Québec City</place> continues to uphold the culture of its motherland. Upon passing through the fortified walls of <place>Old Québec</place>, you'll discover a world straight out of a European painting: 17th- and 18th-century buildings house bakers, bistros and boutiques, while cobbled squares are drowned by a sea of cafe tables. And around every corner, a piece of Québec City's rich heritage awaits discovery.
