Why Go to <place>St. Lucia</place>
Lush, unspoiled <place>St. Lucia</place> has a growing fan base. Some of its vacationers are music lovers, letting loose at the springtime <place>St. Lucia</place> Jazz & Arts Festival (which has previously featured headlining acts like Akon, Ziggy Marley, Diana Ross and the late Amy Winehouse). Others are honeymooners, unwinding on one of the island's chalky beaches or holing up in one of the isolated couples resorts. Still other patrons are adrenaline junkies, testing their limits climbing the Pitons or zip lining through the Chassin region's rain forest. But what you aren't any of these types? Don't worry: <place>St. Lucia</place> refuses to be pigeonholed as any "type" of Caribbean vacation. Plus you also don't have to spend a lot of money (its reputation as a luxurious hideout is only somewhat warranted). To discover some of the island's indescribable charms, you'll have to visit for yourself. Start your mornings basking in an orange-tinted Soufri√®re sunrise then round out your evenings at an evening "jump-up" (or dance party) along Gros Islet. We'll wait to hear what you think.
