This wine region 80 miles south of <place>San Diego</place> is known for its red blends, but most bottles can’t be exported, so a visit is the best way to try the coveted pours. Start at <place>Decantos Vinícola</place>, which uses a flavor-preserving antigravity decanting method for its rich Malbecs. There are several new design-forward hotels here, too: chef Javier Plascencia runsFinca La Divina, a four-room B&amp;B with a pool. It’s just a few miles from his acclaimed <place>Finca Altozano</place> restaurant and Lupe, his torta truck, housed in an Airstream. And in the summer, hacienda-styleEl Cielo Winery will open a 58-suite hotel where you can sip its traditional varietals with abandon.—Archana Ram
