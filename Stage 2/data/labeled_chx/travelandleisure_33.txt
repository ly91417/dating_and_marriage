<place>Kitesurfers</place> have long made a playground of the breezy beaches of <place>Paros</place>, and no wonder: this sunshiny isle is a Cycladic triumvirate of sandy shoreline, history, and culture. Last summer the island debuted a new airport, opening it to larger aircraft and more vacationers. And the fishing village of <place>Naousa</place>, with its boxy white architecture and seaside tavernas, is increasingly sophisticated—check in to the modern, adults-only apartments of <place>Porto Naousaor</place> the elegant <place>Seven Santa Maria</place>, where six airy, all-white suites (and a separate villa) come with a private boat and skipper for exploring the island’s secret coves.—Emily Mathieson
