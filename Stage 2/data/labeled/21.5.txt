Mary, <place>Brussels</place>


Scientists say that chocolate actually does trigger chemicals in the brain that make people feel happier. Some studies indicate that dark chocolate helps with memory and heart function.

But there's chocolate, and then there's Mary -- the nearly century-old chocolatier on <place>Brussels</place>' Rue Royale.

Mary Delluc opened her business in 1919. Her reputation for exacting standards made her a chocolate purveyor to the kings.

Today there are branches throughout <place>Belgium</place>, and even one in <place>Ohio</place>, and anyone can enjoy her little bites of happiness, with caramel, pralines, almond paste or liqueurs.

<place>Table Mountain</place>, <place>Cape Town</place>


<place>Cape Town</place>'s <place>Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden</place>, on the slopes of <place>Table Mountain</place>. 

Not many cities have natural getaways in the middle of them, or at least not on the scale of <place>Table Mountain</place>, which defines <place>Cape Town</place>'s landscape.

Busloads of tourists get dropped off at the cable car, which whisks people up and down the mountainside every few minutes. But the ascent doesn't have to be a hurry.

Trails up the mountain lead away from the crowds and into an experience of nature in the middle of the city.

"The best part about hiking up <place>Table Mountain</place> is that you don't have to drive very far to escape the concrete jungle," says South African hiker Lynette Bannatyne, who's tackled ascents across the country.

"The mountain is situated in the middle of the greater city. From any angle it's a tough vertical climb to get to the top but worth every step for the magnificent views from the summit."
