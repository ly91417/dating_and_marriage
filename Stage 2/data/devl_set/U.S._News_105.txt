Why Go to <place>Copenhagen</place>
While some Europeans revel in haute couture and haute cuisine, the Danes relish what they believe to be the height of sophistication: hygge. Defined as "comfort" or "coziness," hygge is a value reflected throughout <place>Copenhagen</place>, from the skillfully restored antique furniture to the hearty meals served in traditional Danish restaurants. Quality of life is a given, after all the Danes have frequently been named the happiest people in the world. So go ahead, experience life as the Danes do: Hop on a bike and tour <place>Indre By</place> (Inner City), visit the squatters in Christiania, munch on a Danish pastry in Vesterbro or simply wander around and see for yourself why this is one of the most livable cities in <place>Europe</place> .

Tourists are generally drawn to <place>Copenhagen</place> for three reasons: to frolic in the Tivoli Gardens, to pay a visit to the <place>Little Mermaid statue</place> at <place>Langelinie Pier</place> and to shop for antiques along the Str√∏get. But the fun doesn't stop there. Although many of the city's top museums, parks and royal palaces are clustered in or around Indre By, you shouldn't be afraid to branch out. There's gallery-hopping in the <place>Holmen</place> and <place>Islands Brygge</place> areas; beer sampling near <place>Frederiksberg Park</place>; dining Michelin-style in Pilestraede. Just take it slow; it's the Danish way.
