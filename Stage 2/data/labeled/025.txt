Delicious pain at <place>New York</place>'s hottest <place>Sichuan</place> restaurant

His tongue-numbing, eye-watering <place>Sichuan</place> cuisine is not "challenging for the sake of being challenging," Bowien said. There's no wall of fame for daring to dine.

But dishes such as the chile-heaped <place>Chongqing</place> Chicken Wings have a grip on consumers, inspiring hours-long waits at Bowien's <place>Mission Chinese Food</place> in <place>New York</place>.
"When I brought my good friend Eric Ripert here, he took one bite of these chicken wings and ran for the bathroom in a state of real alarm," Bowien fan Anthony Bourdain said as a warning to Anderson Cooper.

Chef Danny Bowien serves up off-the-charts spicy dishes at his restaurants.
Not everyone is such a fan of the eclectic eatery Bourdain calls "the most fun restaurant in <place>New York</place>."

"We're a very controversial restaurant," Bowien said. "Some people love us. A lot of people hate us."

Bowien, who is adopted, is the only Asian member of his <place>Oklahoma City</place> family.

Meals growing up centered around Hamburger Helper, stuffed cabbage, meatballs and tacos. He was 19 when he had his first authentic Korean food.

In his mid-20s, post culinary-school, he discovered <place>Sichuan</place> Chinese cuisine when he was working at fine-dining restaurants in <place>San Francisco</place>.
