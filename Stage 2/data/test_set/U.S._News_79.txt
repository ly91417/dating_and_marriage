Why Go to <place>Montreal</place>
There is only one word that really captures the essence of <place>Montreal</place>: multifaceted. This city represents the melding of the Old and New Worlds, with 18th-century structures blending into a 21st-century skyline. Old-fashioned houses are now home to funky fusion restaurants, and the familiar sound of English is juxtaposed against the rolled "r"s of French. Rainbow flags fly alongside cloth emblems from <place>India</place>, <place>Portugal</place> and <place>France</place>, and traditional French pastries are sold alongside the distinctly sweet sesame seed, Montreal-style bagel. Just when you thought you'd seen it all, a short elevator ride exposes you to another city located several stories below ground level.

This versatile city's top attractions include world-class museums and bustling marketplaces. Start your tour along the ancient cobblestone streets of <place>Vieux-Montréal</place> . Here, you can explore historic cathedrals or grab a cappuccino at one of the traditional French cafes along boulevard Saint-Laurent. If history doesn't excite you, head to the bustling downtown area for an afternoon of shopping or to <place>Parc du Mont-Royal</place> for a hike. Just make sure to save some energy for when the sun sets; Montreal – especially rue St-Denis – is known for a nightlife scene that continues until the wee hours of the morning.
