If <place>Kyoto</place> represents <place>Japan</place>’s spirit, and <place>Tokyo</place> its heart, <place>Osaka</place> is the country’s insatiable appetite. The city’s culinary legacy is alive and at work in the neighborhoods of <place>Tsuruhashi</place> and <place>Fukushima</place>, and in the 91 Michelin-starred restaurants spread throughout the city — like <place>Ajikitcho</place>, specializing in traditional Japanese cooking, and <place>Taian</place>, with a chargrilled focus. On April 28, it will all come together at the International Festival Utage(“feast”), a 10-day food festival, celebrating flavors from <place>Japan</place>’s 47 prefectures.— Kenan Christiansen
