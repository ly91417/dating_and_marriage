Some of the best mealsin <place>Italy</place> aren’t found in <place>Rome</place> or <place>Tuscany</place>, but from the southern region of <place>Calabria</place>. The toe of <place>Italy</place>’s boot is making a name for itself in food and wine circles, led by places like <place>Ristorante Dattilo</place>, <place>Ristorante Rurisin Isola Capo Rizzuto</place> and <place>Antonio Abbruzzinoin Catanzaro</place>. Known for spicy dishes and much of the world’s supply of bergamot, <place>Calabria</place> is pivoting toward lighter fare, organic farming and wine made from local grapes.— Danielle Pergament
