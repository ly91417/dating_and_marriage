The <place>US National Parks</place> turn 100

While nature has had a hand in sculpting the awe-inspiring majesty of the <place>US National Parks</place>, it’s the people who work tirelessly to conserve, protect and share the parks that keep them pristine and perennially available to all who visit.

In commemoration of the Park Service’s centenary on 25 August 2016, BBC Travel uncovers the hidden, unknown side of the parks through the people who know them most intimately: rangers, field guides, scientists, artists and passionate enthusiasts. Each voice reveals a side to the parks that most tourists never see, as well as providing a unique glimpse into what it takes to do their jobs day in and day out.

While a handful of the parks existed as early as 1872, it wasn’t until 1916 that the <place>US National Park</place> Service was officially established – thanks to an Act of Congress signed by then President Woodrow Wilson. BBC Travel’s timeline tells the story of the parks chronologically, starting with <place>Yellowstone</place>, established in 1872, and ending with the newest park, <place>Pinnacles</place>, established as recently as 2013. With 59 parks and counting, who knows what’s in store for the next 100 years!
