Why Go to <place>Dubai</place>
<place>Dubai</place> and <place>Las Vegas</place> have a lot in common. Both cities share a love for the fantastical, with skylines that shine like beacons against barren desert backdrops. People from all over the world flock to these shimmering oases with the same goal: to play hard. But as a vacation spot, <place>Dubai</place> easily trumps ol' Sin City thanks to its gorgeous cream-colored Persian Gulf shoreline, international culinary scene and larger-than-life attractions. And the city's still growing; plans are underway for something bigger and better. It's estimated that a quarter of the world's construction cranes can be found here. If that's any sign, even the sky may not be able to limit Dubai's growth.

<place>Dubai</place> is a city of superlatives, home to the world's tallest tower, the world's largest shopping mall, the world's largest man-made marina... but on a smaller scale, this emirate is still tied to its days as a modest port town. Traditional wooden abras float past motorboats on Dubai Creek, the natural sands of Jumeirah Beach flank the carefully sculpted <place>Palm Islands</place>, and the bustling Gold and <place>Spice Souks</place> (marketplaces) thrive amid the larger-than-life <place>Dubai Mall</place> . Despite constantly looking to the future, this city isn't quick to let go of its past. It's this dynamic that not only put Dubai on the tourist map but will also keep it there.
