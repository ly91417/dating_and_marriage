Why Go to <place>Playa del Carmen</place>
<place>Playa del Carmen</place> has carved its own Euro-chic niche along the <place>Yucatán Peninsula</place> . Sophisticated expats and vacationing Europeans relax at the beachside lounges, upholding this small enclave's budding reputation as the place in Quintana Roo to see and be seen. The area's nerve center is <place>El Zócalo</place>, and similar to Mediterranean beachfront towns like Nice, the funky little public square is within walking distance of the beach. Just off the square and running parallel with the shore, <place>La Quinta Avenida</place> features several blocks worth of delicious eateries and quirky shops. And with proximity to the ancient ruins of Tulum and ample natural landscapes to explore (like Rio Secreto, Xel-Ha and the underwater depths of the Caribbean Sea), Playa del Carmen caters to history buffs and outdoor enthusiasts alike. And of course, <place>Playa<place>'s swaths of white sand and brilliantly turquoise water impress even the most selective beach bums. <place>Cancún</place> is Mexico's vacation of the past – today's savvy beachgoers choose the cosmopolitan "Playa."
