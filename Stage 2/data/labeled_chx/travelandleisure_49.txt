In lieu of the crowded beaches of <place>Cancún</place> and <place>Cozumel</place>, make your way to the state of <place>Veracruz</place>, where the seafood alone is enough to warrant a visit. Enjoy dishes like spicy crab broth on the <place>Emerald Coast</place>, a 12-mile stretch of beach free of crowds and lush with vegetation. Stay at the <place>Maison Couturier</place>, a Design Hotel surrounded by the banana plantations of <place>San Rafael</place>. The French community that’s been there since 1833 sells artisanal cheese andpan de agua,a French-style bread baked in wood ovens. Then venture to <place>Papantla</place>, a well-known Mexican village famous for its pre-Columbian architectural ruins and centuries-old vanilla farms. —Diana Spechler
