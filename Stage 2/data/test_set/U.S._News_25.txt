Why Go to <place>Bangkok</place>
Travelers have a hard time putting a pin in <place>Bangkok</place>'s personality. Most first-timers see this city as one caught between the past and the present. Ancient temples and modern shopping malls comprise <place>Thailand</place>'s capital, and Buddhist monks and regulars of <place>Patpong</place> (<place>Bangkok</place>'s red light district) share the city's streets. The contrast can result in an exhilarating yet chaotic setting.

It's easy to feel overwhelmed here: <place>Bangkok</place>'s dynamic environment requires a lot of energy, and consistently hot weather and persistent crowds take their toll on unprepared visitors. Yes, the city seems to boil over with everything from humidity to humanity, but it's this exotic over-abundance that charms travelers. Here, you'll find the world's largest open-air market, a world-class aquarium housed in an eight-level shopping mall, a 150-foot golden Buddha statue, and so much more. It's a city of vast surprises, so savor its delightful incongruity.
