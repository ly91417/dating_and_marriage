Why Go to <place>Vienna</place>
History is at the heart of Vienna both literally and figuratively. The narrow streets of the Innere Stadt (Inner City) snake through antiquated buildings, providing an atmosphere so authentic that you almost expect a <place>Vienna</place> native like composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart or psychologist Sigmund Freud to round a cobblestone corner and greet you with "guten tag." Extravagant baroque palaces from the Habsburg Monarchy loom over the city, just as Mozart's classical arias pour from contemporary cafes. If it's culture you seek, you'll find it here. 

But there's more to this city than just music and monarchs. <place>Vienna</place> is also a great place to spend some cash, with independent bookstores competing for business alongside haute couture. There are also a surprising number of attractions for young ones, including an amusement park and a top-notch zoo. And although many Viennese retire early in the night, that doesn't mean you have to; sneak out to one of the bars along the city's <place>Bermuda Triangle</place>, or drop by one of the wine taverns skirting the <place>Vienna Woods</place> .
