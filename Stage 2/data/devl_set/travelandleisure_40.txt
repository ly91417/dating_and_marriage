Of the 800 or so mountain gorillas left in <place>East Africa</place>, more than half live in the forested foot hills of the <place>Virungas</place>, a chain of 12,000-foot volcanoes stretching through <place>Rwanda</place>, <place>Uganda</place>, and <place>Congo</place>. <place>Rwanda</place> is by far the safest and most reliable (in terms of infrastructure) of the three, and this summer it will become even more enticing when <place>Wilderness Safaris</place>’ first Rwandan property, the upscale, six-villa <place>Bisate Lodge</place>,opens near <place>Volcanoes National Park</place>. With dramatic views of the forested volcanic peaks, this new base—close to park headquarters, the departure point for daily treks—exists to fund conservation projects, including a reforestation program. In addition to spotting silverbacks, guests can see <place>Buhondo</place> and <place>Burera lakes</place>, the lava tunnels of the <place>Musanze Caves</place>, and the golden monkeys that are endemic to the region. —Jane Broughton
