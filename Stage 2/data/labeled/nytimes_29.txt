January’s second annual Galleries Night Chiang Mai and February’s Documentary Arts Festival, a weeklong biennial, provide opportunities to discover the proliferating art spaces in the historic northern city. Last year’s crop included <place>Chiang Mai</place>’s first contemporary art museum, <place>MAIIAM</place>; the multi disciplinary <place>Asian Culture Station</place>; and <place>Thapae East</place>, an art and performance venue, among others. Art pilgrims can crash at the chic <place>X2 Chiang Mai Riverside</place> hotel, opening this year, or the <place>Art Mai Gallery</place> hotel, decorated by Thai artists.— Seth Sherwood
