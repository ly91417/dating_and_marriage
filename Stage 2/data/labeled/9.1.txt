“Recreating the salt fields makes me really happy because it brings me closer to my ancestors,” said Rosa Chan, an island tour guide and eighth-generation villager. “It’s very fulfilling to be able to do the same thing that our families did centuries ago.”

Rosa lived on the island until she was 13, and then moved to <place>Kowloon City</place> to continue her studies. Later she moved to the <place>UK</place> with her family until she retired.

“When I came back to <place>Hong Kong</place>, I felt like it was my responsibility to help out,” she said. “When I first returned, everything was broken. And the plants were overgrown. The grass scratched my legs.”

The island represents a unique, rarely seen side to <place>Hong Kong</place>.

Her family moved away when she was young in search of a better life, but for Rosa, that life is right here on the island. “I feel at home in nature,” she said. “I love to catch crabs, go fishing – the nature brings me here. I can’t do these things in <place>Kowloon</place>.”

These days, she visits the island twice a week from her home in <place>Kowloon</place> to tend to the gardens and give tours. There are plenty of guests to welcome: the less than 1sqkm island saw nearly 34,000 visitors in 2016, most of whom came to learn about the salt pans, explore the heritage trail, hike around the island or simply find a quiet place to meditate.

Walking through the village, visitors get a sense of the community that once was, thanks to the rows of beautifully crumbling homes with traditional Hakka-style slate roofs and tiled facades. And even though many of the village houses are still run-down and desolate, Rosa doesn’t skip past the broken windows.
