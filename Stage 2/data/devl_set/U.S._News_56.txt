Why Go to <place>Havana</place>
<place>Cuba</place> is full of life, and <place>Havana</place> is its center stage. Come rain or shine, hardship or prosperity, <place>Havana</place> is always beaming with buoyancy. Whether it's the luminous pastel-colored buildings that dot the centuries-old plazas of <place>Old Havana</place>, the fleet of vintage American cars cruising down its streets or the exuberant locals eager to offer you a cafe or dance, <place>Havana</place>'s spirit is contagious and untamable. And with diplomatic ties undergoing historic renovations – some of the country's longstanding socialist policies are falling by the wayside – <place>Habaneros</place> are ready to show the world what they're capable of. Modern paladares, or privately owned restaurants, are opening left and right, cruise ships are docking and dilapidated landmarks are being cleaned up. Once pitied as a city stuck in time, Havana is finally on its way to tomorrow.

Politics aside, the best way to experience the life and style of Havana is to do as the Cubans do. Start each morning with a cafe Cubano or two, dine alfresco in one of <place>Old Havana</place>'s historic plazas, get your feet wet at <place>El Malecón</place>, then dance with the crowds after the sun sets. Seek out mojitos, rum and fun under the sun in Playas de Este, and once you've gotten your fill of the local flavor, acquaint yourself with the country's greats at the Museum of Fine Arts. Don't forget to say goodbye to Hemingway's hideaway on your way out.
