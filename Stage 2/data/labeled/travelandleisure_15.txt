A two-hour drive from <place>Muscat</place>, in the rocky contours of <place>Oman’sAl-Hajar Mountains</place>, is <place>Jebel Akhdar</place>, an area beloved for its astounding views, craggy wadis, and natural terraces. Come spring, a blanket of velvety pink damask rose blossoms shroud the hills with their romantic scent. From these blossoms, distillers produce soothing rosewater potions that are used in both spa treatments and cocktail menus. To best experience Jebel Akhdar, head to the recently openedAnantara Al Jabal Al Akhdar. The magnificent property is giving the region’s reigning boutique hotel, theAlila Jabal Akhdar, a run for its money. While both promise canyon-view infinity pools and post-hike pampering treatments, the Anantara’s splashy suites, six restaurants, and amenities (like a cliff-side private meal), are unbeatable.—Dylan Essertier
