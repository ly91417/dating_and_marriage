Known for its year-round swells, <place>Canada</place>’s surf capital comes with a cold-water reputation that has helped to keep it a relative secret from the rest of the world. But lately, this remote <place>Vancouver Island</place> gem is seeing more visitors for a new reason: wild food. Chefs are using ingredients foraged straight from the <place>Pacific Ocean</place> and huge swaths of temperate rain forest—Tofino’s front and backyard. The salmon is so recently caught that chefs try not to grumble over the fact that the still-tense flesh is difficult to clean. Check out the new <place>Sea Monster Noodle Bar</place>, where the broth simmers with dried kelp and the poke is made with fresh-caught tuna. At Wolf in the Fog, order smoky potato-crusted oysters and sourdough toast topped with just-plucked chanterelles. Pair it with forest-fresh beverages, like the rye infused in-house with raw cedar or <place>Tofino Brewing Company</place>’s seasonal Spruce Tree Ale, steeped with locally foraged <place>Sitka</place> spruce tips. And stay at <place>Long Beach Lodge Resort</place>, where magical days on <place>Cox Bay Beach</place> include foraging treks with chef Ian Riddick—so you can see what the same food looks like in the wild.—Nina Kokotas Hahn
