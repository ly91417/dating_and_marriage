<place>Finland</place> celebrates 100 years of independence on December 6, 2017, but the parties will start much earlier—and many of them will be happening in <place>Helsinki</place>, the capital. The country's gift to itself is a major new landmark: <place>the sinuous Central</place> Library, designed by ALA Architects to be <place>Helsinki’s</place> new living room (it will open in 2018). Sauna culture is a big part of everyday life in the city. The latest and greatest public one <place>isLöyly</place>, a contemporary geometric complex of wood designed by Avanto Architects. And onSauna Day, which takes place twice a year, several unique private saunas, including one on a raft and another in a castle, open to the public. When it comes to a design-savvy place to stay, book a room atLilla Roberts, at least until the summer opening of sister hotelSt. George, a grand 150-room property in a 19th-century landmark building.—Gisela Williams
