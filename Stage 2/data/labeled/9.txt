<place>Hong Kong</place>’s ghost island

The cramped city of <place>Hong Kong</place> isn’t the first place you’d expect to find an abandoned island. But in a quiet corner of <place>Sai Kung</place> district, about 25km northeast of <place>Central</place>, a tiny island offers a rare peek into the past. Affectionately nicknamed “Ghost Island”, <place>Yim Tin Tsai</place> is lush and green – and peppered with decomposing homes.

The island was once home to a thriving Hakka community, a clan that migrated from northern <place>China</place> centuries ago. They settled on the empty island and built salt pans to earn a living. In fact, <place>Yim Tin Tsai</place> means “Little Salt Pan” in Cantonese. When the salt pans shut down more than 100 years ago due to rising competition from <place>Vietnam</place> and <place>China</place>, most residents turned to farming, fishing and husbandry.

At its peak in the 1940s, it’s thought that there were anywhere between 500 and 1,200 people living on the island. But in the 1960s, more and more families left to access education beyond the village’s primary school, moving to <place>Kowloon</place> or further afield to the <place>UK</place>.

The last of the villagers on <place>Yim Tin Tsai</place> emigrated by the 1990s, and, in the years following, <place>Yim Tin Tsai</place> lay empty, with entire homes left to deteriorate.

But, for a handful of villagers, the island represented something special – a unique side of <place>Hong Kong</place>’s history and culture that shouldn’t be forgotten.

New beginnings
If travellers visited <place>Yim Tin Tsai</place> a decade ago, they’d have found nothing but overgrown weeds, crumbling houses and dusty brown fields. That’s exactly what village representative Colin Chan saw when he returned to the island after 40 years.

“I came back here searching to recover something that felt lost,” Colin said. “I found the island was in decay, and I was very upset. This is the place I grew up. This is my father’s home, and his father’s home.”

Chan’s forefathers settled the island more than 300 years ago. An eighth-generation villager, he lived in <place>Yim Tin Tsai</place> until he was seven, relocating to Sai Kung and later to the <place>UK</place> to further his education.

“As a child, I remember running all over the mountains,” he said. “I miss that village feeling. I can't find that in other places in <place>Hong Kong</place> ­– but it still exists here.”
