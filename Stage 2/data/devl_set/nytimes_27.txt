Prices have dropped,but the <place>Greek</place> debt crisis has not dampened <place>Athens</place>’s thriving arts scene. Recent years have seen a surge of galleries, collectives and nonprofit art organizations built for leaner times, like Radio Athènes, which hosts pop-up lectures and performances, and the immigration-focused Nomadic Architecture Network. In October, the renovated <place>EMST National Museum of Contemporary Art</place> opened in a former brewery, while the <place>Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center</place>, designed by Renzo Piano, opened in August. Athens will co-host the 2017 edition ofdocumenta, the influential art exhibition held in <place>Kassel</place>, <place>Germany</place>, since it started in 1955.— Charly Wilder
