<place>Nevis</place> is clearly proud of its link. But did Hamilton’s early experiences in this “forgotten spot”, as the musical calls it, leave their mark on him?

It’s hard to imagine now, but the island was a hub of commerce in the 18th Century; an important British colony covered with lucrative sugar plantations. These now lie in ruin, and their elegant colonial houses have been turned into boutique hotels. But at the time they were home to wealthy planters, whose slaves toiled in the fields outside.

When he was born, Hamilton’s parents were clinging onto this privileged class by their fingertips. His mother, Rachel Faucette, had inherited a small plantation as well as the <place>Charlestown</place> property – but she led a troubled life, including being imprisoned by her first husband for alleged adultery. His father, James Hamilton, was from a propertied Scottish family. He came to the <place>Caribbean</place> in search of wealth, but suffered a string of business failures.

Adding to the family’s stigma, Alexander and his brother were born out of wedlock (his parents never married because Rachel had not divorced her husband). In 1759, after Hamilton was born, her first husband obtained a divorce that allowed him, but not her, to remarry. Hamilton’s illegitimacy may have meant he was excluded from Christian schools. According to his son, John Church Hamilton, Alexander said he had been educated “at the school of a Jewess”, and fondly recalled reciting the 10 commandments in <place>Hebrew</place> when he was so small he had to stand next to her on a table.
