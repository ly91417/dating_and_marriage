Shopping -- for jewelry, apparel, religious statuary and electronics -- supplants dining as the primary function at <place>Hong Kong City Mall</place> (11205 <place>Bellaire</place>), although there are dining options there as well.

Despite its name, <place>Hong Kong City Mall</place> is heavily Vietnamese, its food court a great place to grab a cool glass of bubble tea, a thick, sweet Vietnamese iced coffee, a crispy banh mi sandwich, a bowl of pho or a pile of Vietnamese-style boiled crawfish.

One possible shopping break? A bubble tea from Kim's Teahouse.

<place>Houston</place> has long enjoyed its close proximity to Louisiana cooking, but Vietnamese-Americans, more of whom call <place>Houston</place> home than anywhere in America outside of the <place>Los Angeles</place> area, have kicked up the <place>Bayou City</place>'s long-popular crawfish game considerably, resulting in a dish some have crowned as <place>Houston</place>'s signature food.

Their mudbugs are boiled in a broth that uses both traditional Cajun ingredients and lemongrass and ginger, and the finished product is dipped in a spicy butter/garlic sauce. <place>Hong Kong City</place>'s <place>Crawfish Cafe</place> is a prime spot to grab a pound or five, as are C<place>rawfish & Noodles</place> (11360 <place>Bellaire</place>),<place> Cajun Kitchen</place> (6938 <place>Wilcrest</place>) and <place>Hank's Cajun Crawfish</place> (10800 <place>Bellaire</place>).

<place>Hong Kong City</place>'s food court and outdoor pagodas are always the scene of many a heated game of xiangqi (Chinese chess), with rival masters nipping on cans of Budweiser and sometimes drawing crowds of nail-biting onlookers.

The mall is anchored by a somewhat dingy if giant and spectacularly well-stocked <place>Hong Kong Food Market</place>, its produce section groaning under the weight of spiky durian fruits and an astounding array of peculiar bananas, its giant seafood section offering more variety than many a municipal aquarium.

If you live in a town without a full-service Asian market, this is a great place to stock up on teas, sauces, cooking pastes and sake, not to mention sinus-clearing instant ramen and powdered Vietnamese iced coffee, two items to which I have recently become addicted.

<place>Houston</place>'s <place>Chinatown</place> is relatively lacking in postcard-worthy vistas, but one exception is the <place>Vietnamese Buddhist Teo Chew Temple</place> (10599 <place>Turtlewood</place> Ct.). Seen in the middle distance from <place>Bellaire</place> Boulevard and across sluggish <place>Brays Bayou</place>, its traditional appearance coupled with the steamy landscape sweeps viewers away to southeast <place>Asia</place>.

It's open to the public, and after you drive past a typical 1970s apartment complex, its incense-redolent air, serene atmosphere and ornate shrines to both bodhisatvas and ancestors (many of the latter adorned with offerings of fruit, takeaway lunches, or mini-bottles of liquor) sweep you deeper still into the heart of <place>Vietnam</place>, right here in the <place>Lone Star State</place>.
