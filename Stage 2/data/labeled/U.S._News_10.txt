Why Go to <place>Orlando-Walt Disney World</place>
There's no other city in <place>the United States</place> — the world, even — that celebrates childhood quite like <place>Orlando</place>. The feeling that you get when you catch the light off <place>Epcot Center</place>'s Spaceship Earth (found in Walt Disney World, of course); or from your first sip of Butterbeer in Hogsmeade (located inside Islands of Adventure's Wizarding World of Harry Potter); or when you witness the soaring heights of Shamu's flips (during the "Believe" water show at SeaWorld) — all prove that being a kid is about state of mind, not age. The notion that only young ones will enjoy this city's charms is just that — a notion. In reality, Orlando has a little of this and a little of that to appeal to all ages, and there's more to do here than visit theme parks. The subtropical climate is great for golfing and the downtown city landscape is too attractive not to explore.
