What it's like to eat in <place>London</place>'s naked restaurant


(CNN)I'm in a candlelit <place>London</place> restaurant, sitting opposite a total stranger on a workday afternoon, and we're both completely naked.

And weirdly, it's OK.

Mostly OK.

The restaurant is <place>Bunyadi</place>, a newly opened eatery in a quiet corner of central <place>London</place> that encourages customers to disrobe while enjoying a "natural" dining experience.
