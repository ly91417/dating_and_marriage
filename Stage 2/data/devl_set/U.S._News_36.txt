Why Go to <place>San Miguel de Allende</place>
Vibrantly colored buildings line the cobblestone streets of <place>San Miguel de Allende</place>, a romantic city with 16th-century origins nestled among central <place>Mexico's Sierra Madre Mountains</place>. Through the past 50 years, this quaint city has evolved into a respite for expats and a popular destination for tourists looking to delve into the music, food and arts scene of off-the-beaten-path Mexico. It's easy to swoon over the 500-year-old colonial city's narrow walkways, baroque architecture and artisan shops selling plenty of crafts, jewelry and handmade accessories. Breaks from shopping can be spent exploring the city's defining <place>Parroquia de San Miguel Arcangel</place> church, taking classes at the well-recognized <place>Instituto Allende</place> art school or discovering handcrafted <place>MexicanΩ masks at The Other Face of Mexico gallery.

<place>San Miguel</place>'s location — about 170 miles northwest of <place>Mexico City</place> in <place>Guanajuato</place> state — plays a key role in its dynamic history. Once full of wealth from nearby silver mines, <place>San Miguel</place> was left dilapidated after multiple wars (the early 20th century's Mexican Revolution among them). In 1937, <place>Chicago</place> native Stirling Dickinson stumbled upon the small town, established an artist's colony and quickly got <place>San Miguel</place>'s renaissance off the ground. Today, evidence of that compelling re-emergence can be seen tucked into every lively corner of the diverse, arts-driven destination.
