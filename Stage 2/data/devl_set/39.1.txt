Whether you're traveling solo or in a group, or you're less experienced or 100% ready to hop in a boat, a great place to begin your trip is in <place>Georgetown</place>, a wonderful city on the island of <place>Great Exuma</place>.

Getting there is easy. American Airlines has several flights daily from <place>Miami</place>.

Out-Island Explorers, owned by <place>Dallas</place> and<place> Tamara Knowles</place>, is an outfitter operating out of <place>Georgetown</place>.
Other kayaking tour operators include <place>Starfish</place>: <place>The Exuma Adventure Center</place> and <place>Spirit of the West Adventures</place>.
Out-Island offers day trips around <place>Georgetown</place> and <place>Elizabeth Harbour</place>, but to get a real feel for the islands, you'll want to spend several days and nights meandering around with a four-day/three-night guided expedition or a longer six-day/five-night excursion.

The beautiful <place>Exuma Cays</place>, with closeups of untouched coral reefs, deserted beaches and stunning Caribbean waters, are just paddle strokes away.
