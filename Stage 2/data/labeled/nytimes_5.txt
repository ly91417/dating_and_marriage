With its limestone-paved streetsand 80-foot-high walls surrounding <place>Old Town</place>, this star of the <place>Dalmatian Coast</place> has long been able to rest on its aesthetic laurels — you might recognize it as <place>King’s Landing</place> on “Game of Thrones.” In recent years, though, it has been adding to the luster. This summer, the city is starting an electric-scooter sharing program, allowing for locals and visitors to zip up and down the coast to more private beaches. The four-star beachside <place>Hotel Kompasis</place> a comfy addition to the scene, and the long-awaited renovation of the grande dame <place>Hotel Excelsior</place> will be finished in June. The new restaurant <place>Portraitis</place> serving elevated takes on Dalmatian fare in <place>Old Town</place>.— David Farley
