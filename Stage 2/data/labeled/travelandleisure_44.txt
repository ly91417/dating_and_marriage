A half-hour from Shanghai by bullet train, 2,500-year-old <place>Suzhou</place> has two faces. Most know of its classical gardens (nine UNESCO-designated), celebrated in Chinese art and poetry for centuries, and its canal-filled Old Town with traditional white-washed buildings. But there’s also the high-rise-filled <place>Suzhou Industrial Park</place> (built in partnership with the Singaporean government), which has lured many Fortune 500 companies and is a recreational spot for locals and expats. It has a shopping and entertainment district named <place>Times Square</place>, a <place>London Eye</place> –like Ferris wheel, multiple Western and Asian restaurants, bars, theaters, and a concert hall, plus colorful musical fountains on <place>Jinji Lake</place> at night—and it’s all just a 20-minute subway ride from the heart of <place>Old Town</place>. Over the next two years, <place>W Hotels</place>, <place>Sheraton</place>, and the <place>Luxury Collection</place> join a stampede of Western hotel brands that include the stylish <place>Tonino Lamborghini</place>, a <place>Hilton</place>, and a <place>Hyatt Regency</place>. —Sharon McDonnell
