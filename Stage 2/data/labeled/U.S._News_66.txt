Why Go to <place>Costa Rica</place>
To many, <place>Costa Rica</place>'s charm lies in its lush rainforests, unspoiled beaches and abundance of wildlife. With breathtaking landscapes and a myriad of creatures — from toucans to monkeys to jaguars — it's easy to see why. Where else can you hike active volcanoes, zip line through cloud-covered rainforests and surf warm turquoise waters within the span of just a few days? In this compact but diverse tropical paradise, exhilarating outdoor activities are abundant. Nature-seekers will roam thick jungles while beachgoers will sprawl across the powdery sands. It's hard not to admire all the splendors this "Rich Coast" has to offer.

However, for others, this small <place>Latin American</place> country has a different appeal: it's a relaxed way of life. Residents — known as Ticos — often recite the catchphrase "pura vida" (or "pure life"). This guiding philosophy can be observed from <place>Costa Rica</place>'s central cosmopolitan capital of <place>San José</place> all the way to the sandy Atlantic and Pacific coasts. To truly immerse yourself in the good life, kick-back and admire the awe-inspiring scenery. Surround yourself with graceful butterflies at <place>La Paz Waterfall Gardens</place>, hike along the monumental <place>Arenal Volcano</place>, mingle with locals at Puerto Viejo de Talamanca, or simply sit in a hammock under a palm tree along the Nicoya Peninsula. We have a strong feeling you'll discover the pure life, too.
