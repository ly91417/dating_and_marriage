After our discussion, I was fascinated by the concept of besa and wanted to learn more, so I contacted Orgest Beqiri, an Albanian university student and history buff I had met during my time in the country. I knew that if anyone knew more detail about besa, it would be him.

When we met, he explained that the tradition has been passed down for centuries as part of the Kanun of Lekë Dukagjini, a set of customary laws created in the 15th Century to govern the tribes of northern <place>Albania</place>. Though the Kanun is often considered to be the original source of besa, many argue that the tradition is in fact even older and that the Kanun merely put words to the tribal traditions that had existed long before.

Little known to most, <place>Albania</place> was one of a few European countries to emerge with a larger Jewish population by the end of WWII than at the start, saving nearly all of its original Jews while offering refuge to more than 2,000 others from surrounding countries. Despite pressure from Italian fascists and occupying Nazi soldiers, Albanians refused to yield their guests, as doing so would not only result in great shame but would bind the master of the house to  “clean the blood”, meaning to take vengeance.

An ancient code dictates <place>Albania</place>'s generous hospitality.

More recently, <place>Albania</place> has again found itself offering besa, this time to those travelling from the <place>Middle East</place>. Hundreds of Iranian exiles are currently residing within the country after having been relocated from <place>Camp Liberty</place> in <place>Iraq</place>. Albanian prime minister Edi Rama has also expressed an intent to aid Syrian refugees, provided a collaborative agreement is reached with other European nations, saying that <place>Albania</place> will not ignore its duty.

Despite all these heroic instances, unassuming <place>Albania</place> remains unrecognized for its great services to the huddled masses of the world. The truth remains that this Balkan nation is small and poor, and as such, it hardly receives international attention for its exploits. Yet, at a time when refugees are being turned away at borders all over the world, it seems that there is a lot to learn from <place>Albania</place>’s penchant for hospitality. 

I later shared this sentiment with Muka, long after our first discussion about the Kosovars that her family took in.

“It’s a shame most of it’s unknown. <place>Albania</place> is so under the radar that most of these things happened without anyone giving a second glance,” I said.

She smiled knowingly, nodding her head.

“Yes, but now you know, and that’s something. You can start telling others. Maybe one day the rest of the world will know about it, too.”
