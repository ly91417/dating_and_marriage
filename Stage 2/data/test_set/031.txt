Can you guess the city by looking out of your hotel window?

(CNN)Could you tell the difference between <place>Bangkok</place> and <place>Sao Paulo</place> by looking out of a hotel room window?

It's not as easy as you think, says Swiss photographer Roger Eberhard, who's visited hotel rooms in 32 countries and six continents for a project exploring standardization in our major cities.

In his aptly titled book "Standard," Eberhard photographs <place>Hilton</place> hotel's entry-level double rooms at the same angle in several global cities -- from <place>Sydney</place> and <place>Tokyo</place> to <place>Addis Ababa</place> and <place>Panama City</place> -- alongside snapshots of the world outside the hotel window.

His original mission for the art project shifted during his travels, when he noticed the <place>Hilton</place> rooms weren't the only thing that felt "standard."

â€¯"I started the project thinking that [hotel] rooms look the same everywhere you go, and only by looking out the window are you able to tell where you are in the world... and it was quite the opposite."

Raising questions


Are we in <place>Shanghai</place>, <place>Buenos Aires</place> or <place>Sao Paulo</place>?

Eberhard would open the window curtains in <place>Shanghai</place> and see clusters of skyscrapers in similar angles as those he's seen in <place>Hilton</place> room views of <place>Sao Paulo</place>, <place>Tokyo</place> and <place>Bangkok</place>.

"There were quite a few things about the rooms that looked localized -- sometimes it was the wallpaper or curtains that gave references to the continent or culture -- and on the other hand, the more places I visited, the harder it got by looking out each window to tell where I was."

To emphasize this point-of-view in "Standard," Eberhard purposefully withheld city names of the respective room-and-view pairs until the end of the book.

And though the room view of bustling <place>Bangkok</place> was among Eberhard's more monotonous images, it remains his favorite from the project.
