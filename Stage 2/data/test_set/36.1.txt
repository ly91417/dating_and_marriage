Whole hog sandwiches topped with slaw really hit the spot at <place>Martin's Bar-B-Que</place>.

<place>Martin's Bar-B-Que</place> is one of Wilson's go-tos for casual dining.
Founder and pit master Pat Martin "is another dear friend, but a whole-hog sandwich with slaw on it is like, that's my favorite food. That's my death-row meal," Wilson said.

Martin opened the restaurant's first location in 2006 in <place>Nolensville</place>, <place>Tennessee</place>. There are now four <place>Tennessee</place> locations, including a new spot in downtown <place>Nashville</place>.

For the classics: <place>Arnold's Country Kitchen</place>


Arnold's serve up a range of meats and tantalizing sides, cafeteria-style.

No visit to <place>Nashville</place> would be complete without digging into a meat of your choice accompanied by three delicious Southern side dishes.

"<place>Memphis</place> is a barbecue city, right? We're a meat-and-three city," Wilson said, and Arnold's is a standard-bearer.

"I think that <place>Arnold's Country Kitchen</place> defines our city better than any other restaurant that we have."
But what about the ubiquitous and sought-after <place>Nashville</place> hot chicken? Legend goes that the fiery chicken was originally fried up as a woman's revenge on a cheating man.

It's a little too intense for Wilson's taste.

"I don't really eat it," he said. "I go honky-tonking more than I eat hot chicken, without people in town. It just tears me up. I like good fried chicken and I like spicier fried chicken and don't get me wrong, I'll go eat it, but I don't do anything like 'I want the extra-hot.'"

When he goes, when there are people in town, he goes to <place>Prince's Hot Chicken Shack</place> or <place>Hattie B's Hot Chicken</place>.
Roaming around, sampling life's little pleasures -- and a taste of pain here and there -- really is the thing to do in <place>Nashville</place>.

"That's really most of what we do is eat and listen to music here," Wilson said.
