Hamilton’s forgotten <place>Caribbean</place>

<place>Nevis</place> is less well-known than other <place>Caribbean</place> islands – and Nevisians prefer it that way. It’s only a few miles across the water from lively <place>St Kitts</place>. But here, the most cacophonous noise you’ll hear is the chirping of insects among the lush vegetation.

On the waterfront in <place>Charlestown</place>, the island’s laid-back capital, is a two-storey building with green window shutters and irregular brickwork. On the other side of a well-kept lawn is a brightly painted cafe, where shade and sea breezes offer respite from the energy-sapping heat. But what really draws the visitor’s attention is a plaque on the wall declaring that Alexander Hamilton, the US founding father who features on the country’s $10 bill, was born on this site in 1757.

US founding father Alexander Hamilton was born in <place>Nevis</place>, a lesser-known <place>Caribbean</place> island.

Hamilton’s life story has become increasingly well known since it became the subject of the phenomenally successful hip-hop musical named after him. After spending his early childhood on <place>Nevis</place>, his family moved to <place>St Croix</place> (now part of the <place>US Virgin Islands</place>, but then under Danish rule) in 1765, where he effectively became an orphan after his father left the island and his mother died.

He gained work as a clerk, where his talents were recognised, and he received financial support from local businessmen to study in <place>America</place>. He enrolled at <place>King’s College</place> in <place>New York City</place> (now <place>Columbia University</place>), where he began legal studies, alongside writing political articles supporting the fast-developing revolution against British rule. In 1776, without having graduated, Hamilton became an artillery commander in the Continental Army that fought the <place>British</place>, and the next year, was appointed as aide-de-camp to general George Washington, a role he served in for four years. From 1789 to 1795, he served as Secretary of the Treasury in Washington’s cabinet.

Hamilton favoured strong central government (his enemies accused him of being a monarchist) and a modern industrial economy. Among his notable achievements were supporting the ratification of the US Constitution in essays known as the Federalist Papers, which are still used as a reference point by judges interpreting the constitution. He also established a national banking system. But the museum next to Hamilton House, as the building in <place>Charlestown</place> is known, is keen to point out smaller feats, even suggesting that he was responsible for the tradition of eating turkey on Thanksgiving.
