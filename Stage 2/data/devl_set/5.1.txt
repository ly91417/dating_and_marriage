American art historian and archaeologist Victoria Lautman, author of the upcoming book The Vanishing Stepwells of <place>India</place>, described the sensory overload of her first descent into a stepwell: “The contrasts were so pronounced, all my senses were activated: bright light became murky dark, intense heat became cool surrounding air, and the incessant din above-ground became hushed – the deeper I went the more everything transformed.”

While stepwells are largely to be found in the arid north and west of <place>India</place>, they are not unique to those regions. In the country’s south, they take on the form of temple tanks (locally known as kalyani or pushkarani), which fulfilled essentially the same function.

<place>India</place>’s oldest stepwell is believed to date to 600 CE, although most of those still standing were built after the 10th Century. Stepwells proliferated in public areas in towns as well as along important trade routes, and were open for use by the entire community. As such, over time they became a social hub for travellers and for women, who would come to fetch water each day, with fine architectural and design elements incorporated into the basic structure: think graceful arches, handsome pillars and ornate carvings.

Just 100 years ago, there were close to 3,000 of these fascinating reservoirs scattered across water-scarce regions of India. However, as a result of diminishing underground water tables, due to a growing population, and the movement towards private water sources such as taps and tanks, stepwells have fallen into disuse. British rulers also deemed stepwells unhygienic and breeding grounds for disease, filling them up with mud or sealing them off from the public.

Today, many of the remaining ancient stepwells are neglected and dilapidated; some even used as rubbish dumps. In many cases, entire communities are unaware of the existence of an old stepwell in their area or simply do not consider them significant in any way.
