Slicker than graffiti-laden <place>Berlinand</place> edgier than <place>Munich</place> or <place>Frankfurt</place>, this booming port town has always been one of <place>Germany</place>’s most intriguing cities. Recent years have seen the banks of the <place>Elbe River</place> morph into an architectural wonderland, with icons such as <place>Zaha Hadid’s River Promenade</place> reshaping the landscape. The <place>Elbphilharmonie Hamburgby Herzog</place> &amp; de <place>Meuron</place>, a concert hall featuring an undulating glass structure on top of a midcentury brick warehouse, will welcome visitors for its inaugural performance on January 11, 2017. Not far away,The <place>Fontenay</place>, a stylish grande dame, will open its doors in summer. The once-gritty isle of <place>Wilhelmsburg</place> is transforming into a hot spot, drawing comparisons to the similar-sounding <place>Williamsburg</place> in <place>Brooklyn</place> thanks to projects like IBA <place>Hamburg</place> – <place>Energiebunker</place> —a former air-raid bunker converted into an eco-friendly power source—WCW Gallery, and third-wave coffee shops like <place>Kaffeeliebe</place>. —Diana Hubbell
