Once beleaguered by frequent strikes, roadblocks, and a paucity of amenities, the backpacker haven of <place>La Pazhas</place> emerged as a true culture capital. Infrastructure has played a key role: in 2014 the city introduced Mi Teleférico, a network of aerial trams that transport riders across the city in minutes on routes that once took an hour by bus. The city’s culinary scene is being driven by fine-dining restaurant Gustu, launched by Noma cofounder Claus Meyer in 2013. Since then, the restaurant scene has exploded with ventures from Gustu alums: elevated vegan fare at Ali Pacha,locally inspired pastas at Propiedad Pública,and house-roasted, single-origin coffee at <place>Typica</place>. Stay in the city’s first Design Hotel, <place>the Atix</place>. Each of the 53 rooms doubles as a gallery, displaying works by Bolivian artists like Gastón Ugalde. It’s a microcosm of the city’s thriving contemporary art scene: galleries like Mérida Romero,Mamani Mamani, and the reopened Salar Galería de Arte showcase much of the country’s top talent.—Nicholas Gill
