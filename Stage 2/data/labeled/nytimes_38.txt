This archipelago, a two-and-a-half-hour flight from <place>Oslo</place> and more than 100 miles north of the <place>Arctic Circle</place>, is an idyllic haven for outdoor adventurers and artists. The craggy mountains that drop dramatically into cobalt waters make it a favorite with hikers, cyclists, kayakers and a growing number of surfers. The same striking landscape is popular with artists who turned cod factories into galleries for contemporary art, ceramics and photography. New hotels like <place>Svolvaer Havn</place> are opening to accommodate the growing number of visitors, while perennial favorites like <place>Thon Hotel Lofoten</place> have undergone renovations. And with more nonstop flights from the low-cost carrier Norwegian Air, it’s all that much easier to get to <place>Norway</place>.— Kelly DiNardo
