Why Go to <place>Bonaire</place>
On <place>Bonaire</place>, the main attractions lie beneath the water's surface. In other words, don't plan a trip to this island unless you want to get friendly with some of <place>Bonaire</place>'s magnificent sea dwellers. The oft-overlooked sister island to <place>Aruba</place> and <place>Curaçao</place>, Bonaire is more famous for its impressive diving than its air of exclusivity. To travel to this "diver's paradise" (as the island's license plates boast) without exploring underwater treasures would be a regrettable misstep.
Though any Caribbean getaway promises a welcome retreat from the clutches of your smart phone, <place>Bonaire</place> is less about relaxing and more about adventure. If you're not an avid diver, hike around <place>Washington Slagbaai National Park</place> and admire the breathtaking scenery, or get off the beaten path and bike the island's unpaved roads. It's hard to believe that there's so much to do on an island that only measures 112 square miles. You could see the island in just one day… But would you want to?
