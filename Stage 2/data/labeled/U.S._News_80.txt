Why Go to <place>Victoria</place> & <place>Vancouver Island</place>
Although it's only a 90-minute ferry ride from bustling <place>Vancouver</place>, <place>British Columbia</place>'s capital city may as well be a world away. Taking the opposite approach from its youthful neighbor, <place>Victoria</place> exudes a quainter atmosphere. Resting on the southern tip of <place>Vancouver Island</place>, This relatively small city remains deeply rooted in its Colonial past, relishing distinctively British traditions like afternoon tea at the <place>Fairmont Empress</place> and a pint at the pub. But that doesn't mean this destination is strictly reserved for <place>Anglophiles</place> . Despite its nostalgic tendencies, this city attracts a variety of travelers with excellent museums that celebrate its aboriginal heritage, charming architecture and fantastic harbor views (often interrupted by the surfacing of a whale).
