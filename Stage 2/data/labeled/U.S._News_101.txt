Why Go to <place>Lisbon</place>
Often overlooked for its popular European cousins, <place>Lisbon</place> specializes in lulling tourists into its laid-back charm. Perched atop seven hills, its alleyways wind between colorful, centuries-old buildings. Fanciful <place>St. George's Castle</place> peeks out to the skyline, lending an Old World mystery to the burgeoning cosmopolitan city. And despite the modern sleek buildings that are slowly rising throughout the city, village life holds strong.

But there's more to <place>Lisbon</place> than lazing about in coffee shops nibbling past√©is de nata (custard tarts) all day: From exploring the Fado clubs in <place>Bairro Alto</place> to taking in the view at the top of <place>the Santa Justa Elevator</place>; from laying out at the Cascais beaches to treasure hunting at the historic <place>Feira da Ladra flea market</place>; from gazing at the gargantuan displays at the <place>Oceanarium</place> to gorging on bacalhau (salted cod); <place>Lisbon</place>'s coastal capital is rich with opportunity.
