He encouraged me in his easy Irish manner, pushing a freshly severed chicken foot into my gloved fist. Then I stuck my left arm straight out to the side, tensing my shoulder as <place>Lima</place>, the beautiful brown Harris’s hawk, swooped down in a gush of wind, lighting upon the edge of my covered wrist. I rotated my hand as her sabre-like beak snapped up the chicken foot. She swallowed it whole, shaking her gullet, then blinked with satisfaction.

Ashford Castle is a historical Irish castle in western <place>Ireland</place>.

We were hunting for small game in the vast forest of <place>China</place> – some 350 acres of thick woodlands – surrounding historic <place>Ashford Castle</place> at the northern tip of <place>Lough Corrib</place> in western <place>Ireland</place>. As we stepped deeper into the ancient woods, massive tree trunks rose up like Greek columns with a vaulted ceiling of green, heart-shaped leaves. The day was warm and overcast, a dry spell following the wet and gloomy Irish morning.
