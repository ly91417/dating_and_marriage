<place>Burren</place> and <place>Cliffs of Moher Geopark</place> promotes the future of treasures dotting <place>Ireland</place>’s Atlantic coast, like these Neolithic tombs in <place>County Clare</place>.

WINNER: <place>Burren and Cliffs</place> of Moher Geopark, Ireland 

It’s a common problem in many parts of the rural world: Once thriving villages become economic backwaters as business opportunities shift from the countryside to urban centers. That’s what the project known as the <place>Burren</place> and <place>Cliffs of Moher Geopark</place>. LIFE set out to change in <place>County Clare</place>, on <place>Ireland</place>’s Atlantic coast, a place dotted with farms, villages, and walking trails.

Conservation work includes repairing walls damaged by tourists.

“By developing a destination-wide partnership with the <<place>Burren</place> and <place>Cliffs of Moher Geopark</place>>Burren</<place>Burren</place>> Ecotourism Network, we’re bringing communities, businesses, and municipal authorities together to create a sustainable future for our rural way of life,” says Geopark manager Carol Gleeson, who grew up on a nearby farm.

Key to the project’s success: ensuring that the <place>Cliffs of Moher</place>, soaring 650 feet above crashing waves, are not just photo ops for day-trippers. Attractions such as the <place>Burren Outdoor Activity Trail</place> and the <place>Burren Food Trail</place>—featuring food producers and culinary artisans, and a winner of a 2015 European Destination of Excellence award for local gastronomy—now have more travelers spending more time in this scenic region.

Among <place>China</place>’s city dwellers, they’re called “breathers”—vacations focused on nature and clean air. <place>Mission Hills</place> offers both at its three resort complexes. “We want to be the positive change in <place>China</place> that we believe is needed for a greener future,” says Ken Chu, the young chairman of <place>Mission Hills</place>, who is part of a growing Chinese environmental movement.
