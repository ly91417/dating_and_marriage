Since the end of the Yugoslav wars, <place>Belgrade</place> has attracted steady investment—its graffiti-covered neighborhoods are now full of restaurants and bars. You’ll find hearty platters of ćevapi—smoky sausages without casing—and stuffed somborka peppers at <place>Sokače</place>, paprika-laden kebabs at <place>Tri Šešira</place>, and pan-Latin tapas at <place>Toro</place>. But the biggest draw is the growing craft-beer scene (the city has 37 breweries). Don’t miss the Kabinet Supernova IPA at <place>Prohibicijain</place> the bar-filled <place>Savamala district</place>, as well as Kas’s full-bodied pale ales and Salto’s IPA at <place>Bajloni</place>, set in a 100-year-old brewery space in <place>Cetinjska</place>.—Govind Dhar
