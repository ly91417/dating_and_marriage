This 3.2-million-acre wet land in northeast <place>Argentina</place> is still off the radar for most visitors, overshadowed by <place>Patagonia</place>. But the government and organizations like the Conservation Land Trust are involved in an extensive “rewilding” project that is repopulating the area with plants and animals, including jaguars. And last year Tompkins Conservation began donating additional land for the creation of <place>Iberá National Park</place>, which, when complete, will be the largest protected natural area in <place>Argentina</place>.— Kelly DiNardo
