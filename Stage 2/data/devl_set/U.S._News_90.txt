Why Go to <place>Florence</place>
This little city, tucked amid the <place>Tuscan hills</place>, casts a long shadow through history. The wellspring of the <place>Renaissance</place>, <place>Firenze</place> (or Florence) sheltered the powerful Medici family and inspired artists like Michelangelo (David) and Brunelleschi (the Duomo). If it weren't for the fashionable Italians and chic shops lining Via Tornabuoni, you might think you had traveled back in time to the 14th century. But Renaissance art is not the only reason to come: You also visit Florence for its gorgeous sunsets, its Italian cooking and its unbeatable romantic charm.
