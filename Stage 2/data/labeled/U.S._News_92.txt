Why Go to <place>Amsterdam</place>
Don't believe everything you hear about <place>Amsterdam</place> . Yes, this <place>Netherlands</place> city takes a lax look at women beckoning business in the <place>Red Light District</place> and "coffee shops" selling an unorthodox type of herb to a toking clientele, but these descriptions only scratch the surface. At some point, during an excellent Indonesian meal, a twilight canal-side rambling or a shopping excursion through the boutiques of <place>Nine Little Streets</place>, you'll realize – as many travelers have before you – that there's much more to Amsterdam than you might've thought.

And although the city's loose laws on vice seem to attract a college-age, male-dominant crowd, <place>Amsterdam</place> is also ideal as a romantic getaway for two or an educational excursion with the kids. With attractions that range from biking along a maze of canals to remembering the Holocaust through the eyes of Anne Frank; from exploring the swirling Expressionism of Vincent van Gogh to lazing in the expansive <place>Vondelpark</place>, <place>Amsterdam</place> suits a variety of traveler tastes.
