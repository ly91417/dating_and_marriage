One of the most important lessons to emerge from decades of conservation in <place>Africa</place> is that unless the people who live closest to wildlife become allies in protecting endangered species, lasting conservation is elusive. Enter the Bushcamp Company, which operates <place>Mfuwe Lodge</place> and six safari camps in <place>South Luangwa National Park</place>, a vast haven offering some of the continent’s most spectacular wildlife experiences. 

The Bushcamp Company offers some of the most spectacular safari experiences on the continent.

“Tourism plays a huge role in protecting nature in <place>Zambia</place>,” says managing director Andy Hogg. “We do that by working with villagers to provide jobs, build schools, and improve rural livelihoods.”

Bushcamp, the area’s largest employer, pumps more than $300,000 yearly into conservation and community development, including on-the-job training, scholarships for 350 students, 3,000 anti-malaria bed nets, and a daily meal for 1,600 schoolchildren (within a year their exam pass rate rose from 53 percent to 91 percent as teachers reported increased attendance). Bushcamp also donates funds to the South Luangwa Conservation Society to support its anti-poaching patrols.

The best way to understand indigenous culture is to travel with companies owned by indigenous people. Meet Ceillhe Tewhare Teneti Hema Sperath, who, with her husband, Neill, founded TIME Unlimited Tours in 2005. The name is an acronym for the company mission, To Integrate Maori Experiences, says Sperath, herself a descendant of two Maori chiefs who signed the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi, <place>New Zealand</place>’s founding document.

“It is very important for us to represent the intergenerational vision our ancestors had to be the kaitiaki [guardians] of this special place we call <place>Aotearoa</place>, also known as <place>New Zealand</place>,” she explains. 

The Speraths want to share Maori culture through personalized journeys in <place>New Zealand</place>’s mystical landscapes, including the Waitakare Ranges and Rotorua’s geothermal pools and geysers. Their approach has earned TIME Unlimited the country’s highest certification for environmental and social responsibility. “We create experiences that help travelers understand our tribal legends as living legacies,” Sperath says, “a sense of place we call home.”

Travelers see the conservation economy at work with local outfitters offering hiking in the lush mountain region about four hours north of <place>Mexico City</place>.

For 29 years Grupo Ecológico Sierra Gorda, a grassroots nonprofit organization, has worked to protect one of the world’s loftier biodiversity enclaves—the Sierra Gorda, a lush mountain region some four hours’ drive north from <place>Mexico City</place>—by building a “conservation economy.” 

Much of what the group does “focuses on improving the daily lives of women, so that they become the voice of conservation in their communities,” says Martha Isabel Ruiz Corzo, the director. “This has created a network of 83 small ecotourism businesses, many led by village women who previously struggled in poverty.” 

Grupo Ecológico Sierra Gorda also aided the establishment of the 950,000-acre Sierra Gorda Biosphere Reserve, home to diverse ecosystems—including <place>Cuatro Palos</place>, where forest and desert meet, and Sótano del Barro, a massive sinkhole where endangered macaws nest—as well as the <place>Franciscan Missions World Heritage</place> site. Travelers see the conservation economy at work among local outfitters offering hiking and other excursions, and artisans such as Doña Dorotea, who runs a pottery studio.
