Why Go to <place>Bora Bora</place>
The small island of <place>Bora Bora</place> (just 6 miles long and more than 2 miles wide) overflows with beauty. Dormant volcanoes rise up at its center and fan out into lush jungle before spilling into an aquamarine lagoon. In fact, author James Michener, who wrote "Tales of the South Pacific," called <place>Bora Bora</place> "the most beautiful island in the world." The 18th-century British explorer James Cook even coined it as the "pearl of the Pacific." The very definition of a tropical getaway, blissful <place>Bora Bora</place> abounds with luxurious resorts, sunny skies, warm waters and friendly locals. And as you might've already guessed, the main industry on this petite island in <place>French Polynesia</place> and its swarm of tiny motu (small surrounding islands) is tourism. To that end, you can snorkel, explore Vaitape (Bora Bora's quaint town), hike Mount Otemanu and more. But there's a catch: Bora Bora is expensive â€” very expensive. In short, visit Bora Bora for natural beauty, visit for utter relaxation and visit if you have the money.
