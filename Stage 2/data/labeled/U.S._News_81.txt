Why Go to <place>Victoria</place> & <place>Vancouver Island</place>
Although it's only a 90-minute ferry ride from bustling <place>Vancouver</place>, <place>British Columbia</place>'s capital city may as well be a world away. Taking the opposite approach from its youthful neighbor, <place>Victoria</place> exudes a quainter atmosphere. Resting on the southern tip of <place>Vancouver Island</place>, This relatively small city remains deeply rooted in its Colonial past, relishing distinctively British traditions like afternoon tea at the Fairmont Empress and a pint at the pub. But that doesn't mean this destination is strictly reserved for Anglophiles. Despite its nostalgic tendencies, this city attracts a variety of travelers with excellent museums that celebrate its aboriginal heritage, charming architecture and fantastic harbor views (often interrupted by the surfacing of a whale).

But don't limit yourself to the (admittedly kitschy) Inner Harbour – there's much more to this region than manicured gardens and afternoon tea. <place>Vancouver Island</place> is also known for its stretching beaches and verdant wineries. From downtown Victoria, drive to Sooke – a vibrant boating and fishing town – or make your way out to the <place>Cowichan Valley</place>, where you'll find rows of vines laden with grapes. Just make sure to bring your camera, as the scenery is sure to delight even the most jaded traveler.
