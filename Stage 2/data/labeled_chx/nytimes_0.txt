<place>Canada</place> is huge— the second-largest country by area. It’s also a world unto itself, with cosmopolitan cities, barely explored natural wonders and everything in between. And this is the year to visit: In honor of the 150th anniversary of its confederation, when the original colonies came together as one country, <place>Canada</place> is rolling out the welcome mat. All of the country’smore than 200 national parks and historic sitesare offering free admission through the year, from the turquoise lakes and mountain peaks of <place>Banff</place> in <place>Alberta</place> to the rolling dunes and red sandstone cliffs of <place>Prince Edward Island</place> along the <place>Atlantic Coast</place> to the newest reserve, the glacial-rounded <place>Mealy Mountainsin Labrador</place>. Meanwhile, in the capital, <place>Ottawa</place>, a full year of celebration is planned; more events will be on offer in <place>Montreal</place>, which turns 375. And did we mention the exchange rate? A weak <place>Canadian</place> dollar means American travelers get more for their money. So 2017 offers an ideal time to go north.— Remy Scalza
