Why Go to <place>Jackson Hole</place>
Sandwiched between <place>Grand Teton National Park</place> to the north and miles of national forest in every other direction, the <place>Jackson Hole valley</place> has remained relatively isolated from the burgeoning travel industry. Instead it has survived on local industries like logging, ranching and, during the 19th century, fur trading. But recently, <place>Jackson Hole</place> has encouraged the rise of tourism. Former blue-collar settlements like Jackson and <place>Grand Teton</place> now boast notable art and performance venues, and mega ski resorts have transformed the region into an up-and-coming winter wonderland. When planning an opulent getaway, many people don't give western Wyoming a thought. To those travelers, we say: Think again.

Sure, you won't encounter the glitz and glam of Aspen or Lake Tahoe, but the beauty and vastness of the Jackson Hole region has caught the attention of Hollywood celebs like Harrison Ford and politicos like former Vice President Dick Cheney. Yet, even with its fresh and luxurious upgrade, Jackson Hole remains first and foremost the heart of mountain country, with rugged trails and miles of open space that recall a time before the West was won.
