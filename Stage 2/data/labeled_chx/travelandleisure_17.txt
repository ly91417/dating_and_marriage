Concealed by Alpine peaks and rolling, wooded hills, <place>Jura—France’s</place> smallest wine region—has long been shielded from the swarms that descend upon <place>Burgundy</place> to the west and <place>Switzerland</place> to the east. But in recent years, the <place>Jura’s</place> highly idiosyncratic, oxidative wines have generated explosive interest, with bottles making regular appearances on sommelier lists at <place>U.S.</place> restaurants like <place>Eleven Madison Park</place> and the French Laundry. Thanks to the newfound attention, the secret of Franche-Comté’s remote gem—a medieval-era region perfect for gourmands and nature-lovers—is out at last. Oenophiles will want to visit buzzy vineyards likeDomaine André &amp; Mirielle Tissot; co-owner Stéphane Tissot is a dynamic, progressive vintner who produces one of Jura’s famous sherry-likevin jaunes. Pair them with the Jura’s rich, rustic cuisine and the regional specialty, wheels of raw-milk Comté cheese. Burn off the calories hiking, cycling, or skiing the miles of quiet trails that arc around steep mountain ridges, shimmering lakes, and primordial waterfalls. For lodgings, turn to <place>Les Jardins sur Glantine</place>, a charming B&amp;B that also produces superb natural wines.—Christopher Ross
