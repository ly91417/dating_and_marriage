There was certainly a sizeable Sephardic Jewish community on <place>Nevis</place> at the time. The island still has a Jewish cemetery just off <place>Charlestown</place>’s main street, where 19 mostly well-preserved graves are dotted around a small grassy enclosure, the oldest dating from 1679 (archaeological research suggests there were at least 40 more burials that no longer have tombstones). The rectangular slabs, lying horizontally, have weather-worn inscriptions in <place>Hebrew</place>, <place>Spanish</place> and <place>Portuguese</place>, and are scattered with small stones placed by visitors, in accordance with Jewish custom.

At one point it was thought that a building behind the <place>Nevis</place> Island Administration offices was a former synagogue. This has now been disproven. But by analysing land records, researcher Michelle Terrell has identified the site where the synagogue did use to stand. Close to the cemetery, it formed part of a Jewish quarter in a less desirable part of town. Was this the location of the school Hamilton attended?

There is more that we could speculate on. Can Hamilton’s pragmatic desire for national stability be traced back to his own unstable childhood? Did his skills for influencing and manoeuvring develop to help him survive as an orphan? Did his hot-headed streak, which eventually led to his death in a duel in 1804 in <place>Weehawken</place>, <place>New Jersey</place>, on a ledge overlooking the <place>Hudson River</place>, have its roots in the sometimes lawless world of the <place>Caribbean</place> colonies?

What is certain is that Hamilton is hard to pin down. Some see him as an unprincipled social climber, while others believe he’s the encapsulation of the American Dream. Historians even dispute the year he was born, with some saying it was 1755, not 1757. And there is also disagreement about the location. We know that the current Hamilton House is a restoration. But some think that he wasn’t born on that site at all.

Richard Lupinacci, who owns The Hermitage hotel, a wooden former plantation house near the site of Hamilton’s mother’s estate, said that he had heard a different story from descendants of old planter families.

“They said that he wasn’t born in <place>Charlestown</place> – he was born up here in the country in 1755,” he said. “He would have lived in both places.”

Sitting beneath the building’s white-beamed ceiling in a room furnished with dark varnished chairs and tables and a patterned Persian rug, the history enthusiast told me that Hamilton’s family would have been welcome at the Hermitage, whose owners at that time were in the “second tier” of <place>Nevis</place> society. But Hamilton was probably ashamed of his childhood. “[The Hamilton family] were not in the upper echelon of the society here. It was very class conscious. He felt embarrassed and a bit disgraced. He doesn’t talk about happy times,” Lupinacci said.

While Hamilton was keen not to dwell on his time in <place>Nevis</place>, it’s impossible not to wonder what effect it had on him. We may never know the full story. But there’s always the chance that there’s another twist.
